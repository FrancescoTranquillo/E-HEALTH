"5";NA;"Health & Fitness";4;"108 names of lord Ganesh will bring peace, prosperity and good health to you and your family.Listen to 108 names of lord Ganesha and feel one with lord Ganesha.Ganesha also known as Ganapati and Vinayaka, is one of the best-known and most worshipped deities in the Hindu pantheon. His image is found throughout India, Sri Lanka and Nepal. Hindu sects worship him regardless of affiliations. Devotion to Ganesha is widely diffused and extends to Jains and Buddhists.Although he is known by many attributes, Ganesha's elephant head makes him easy to identify. Ganesha is widely revered as the remover of obstacles, the patron of arts and sciences and the deva of intellect and wisdom. As the god of beginnings, he is honoured at the start of rituals and ceremonies. Ganesha is also invoked as patron of letters and learning during writing sessions. Several texts relate mythological anecdotes associated with his birth and exploits and explain his distinct iconography.Ganesha emerged as a distinct deity in the 4th and 5th centuries CE, during the Gupta Period, although he inherited traits from Vedic and pre-Vedic precursors. He was formally included among the five primary deities of Smartism (a Hindu denomination) in the 9th century. A sect of devotees called the Ganapatya arose, who identified Ganesha as the supreme deity. The principal scriptures dedicated to Ganesha are the Ganesha Purana, the Mudgala Purana, and the Ganapati Atharvashirsa.Key Features:=  Very good and simple User Interface=  Very Soothing Flowers coming on the screen randomly=  Very good quality of sound=  Image change in 5 seconds so that you get to see more images every minute=  Temple Bells and Shankh to give you a Temple-like experience.=  Gives you a very peaceful experience.=  Used by Top celebrities from Bollywood and Glitterati.";"Dipen Ambalia";0;"4";1466294400

"7";NA;"Health & Fitness";4;"Get rid of the beer belly with this awesome 15 Minutes Total Body Active Workout Challenge. Moreover, work from home!! This is a great way to get a good muscle burn without doing a really high intensity cardio workout. With the Active-Static style of training you have a group of two different exercises that use a similar position and utilize the same muscle groups. For example, the first group of exercises in the workout video are a traditional push up and a plank. Both of these exercises utilize almost identical muscle groups, actually the only muscle group that is not used by both exercises is the triceps which is more predominately used in the push up and is either not used or only lightly used depending on the style of plank you choose to do.The term static means lack of movement. And as this term implies, with static training you take a weight and hold it in a fixed position for several seconds. This concept is based on the idea that by forcing the muscle to work only when it is maximally contracted and using the heaviest weight possible, you can optimize its growth potential. You have to admit that it makes sense. The question is, does it work?The answer is yes; it does work when used properly. This is due mainly to the overload that's involved, as well as to the unique stimulus with which it jolts the muscle.When you train using a full ROM, the amount of weight you can use is limited by your sticking point—the point in the exercise ROM where you're weakest. You can only use as much weight as you can lift through that sticking point. With static contractions, you eliminate the sticking point, so you can overload the muscle fibers with as much weight as you can hold for at least 10 seconds in a particular muscle's strongest position.Static contraction training may seem like a new concept, but it's hardly a radical, untested training philosophy.";"Cristina Gheorghisan";0;"1.3";1485648000

"42";NA;"Health & Fitness";4;"As a new mom, you're busy morning till night, but that doesn’t mean you can’t squeeze in an effective workout. To prove it, we’ve put together some quick, energizing exercises that you can do at home in minutes. These simple moves work your whole body yet don’t require hours of effort—plus, your baby will be front and center during these moves, so the two of you can bond while you’re working out. You can do the “quickie” routines separately or together every other day. With your doctor’s approval, it’s fine to start doing these exercises as early as six weeks after you’ve given birth (probably longer if you had a Cesarean section).TIPS:* Baby safety: When performing exercises in which your baby must hold his head up on his own, be sure he can do so without discomfort (usually starting at 3 to 4 months old).* Mom prep: Before performing any exercise, roll your shoulders back and down and draw your navel toward your spine to protect your back. Inhale through your nose and expand your ribs. Exhale through your mouth, drawing your abdominal muscles in.Exercises - 20 seconds each - 3 series with 1 minute rest between series:- Lunges- Squats- Bridges- Lifts- Sitting twists- Push-ups- Planks6 REASONS to start training:1. Build yourself a smashing fit body - because there is no greater feeling than looking in the mirror and simply just love what you see.2. Brag around about your toned muscles - low body fat level, noticeable muscle definition and shape, but not significant muscle size3. Keep your heart strong and healthy - because your heart is a muscle also and it gets stronger and healthier if you live an active life. 4. A clear and beautiful glowing skin - you don't have to worry anymore about cellulite when you're half naked on the beach. No more dimply skin coming out of your swimsuit.5. Reduce stress, anxiety and fight depression - regular training is the key for your head just as it is for your heart and will relax you, making you calmer, fighting depression and dissipate stress.6. A happier soul and a bigger smile - you will feel that you are finally doing something for yourself.BONUS: Improve your live life! you know exercise is good for you, but do you know how goof?

"54";NA;"Health & Fitness";4;"This program is designed to help the user improve spatial orientation and memory.  The user must locate the red dot after it appears, then disappears.  The user must “activate” the blue dot by touching it before the invisible red dot can be found.  Once the blue dot is activated it will turn green and then the user may attempt to find where the dot was located.There are four variations in this game.1)	One after the other – find dots one after the other2)	Digit span – find dots but also remember a sequence of numbers and letter, which user must enter at the end of the game.3)	All at once – user must find multiple dots which appear all at once, all on the same game.4)	Sequential – user must find multiple dots which appear in a sequence, all on the same game. There are many parameters that can be set to ensure the user can be challenged at the appropriate level.  To make things easier, the user may choose to use the grid or the “reveal” options. To make things easier the user may choose to add an activation delay, forcing the short term memory to hold on to the memory of the dot location for longer.";"Paul Michael";1,99;NA;NA
"55";NA;"Medical";12;"Accutension is a Smartphone Auscultatory Blood Pressure Kit, or manual BP on the phone. According to a clinical research published in American Journal of Hypertension (https://academic.oup.com/ajh/article/30/7/683/3739803/An-Assessment-of-the-Accuracy-of-Home-Blood), 36% home blood pressure monitor users can not get accurate reading with their own device, because of the intrinsic design problem. The invention of Accutension is to improve blood pressure measurement accuracy.Accutension improves accuracy by employing doctors' blood pressure measurement method. Doctors use a stethoscope to listen to the sounds of blood flow pulse to find out blood pressure values during BP cuff deflation. Accutension uses the same method but even better because,1. Accutension records the sounds (Korotkoff sounds) of the blood flow pulse during measurement;2. Accutension visualizes the sounds, so you will see the sounds on your phone screen when you hear the sounds;3. You can playback the sounds after measurement to re-confirm the blood pressure readings;4. You can email the measurement raw data including the sounds to a medical professional to double confirm the reading if you are not sure.Accutension is different from those automatic blood pressure monitors that do not sense the sounds. The automatic blood pressure monitors normally use oscillometric algorithms to estimate blood pressure values. Different manufacturers use different algorithms and could give very different readings.Accutension is different from those smart blood pressure monitors, which mainly use smartphone to store the readings. Accutension uses the smartphone as a part of the instrument to find the readings other than just store the readings. Except this big difference, Accutension has the same features as other smart blood pressure monitors. For example:1. Accutension stores both the result and the raw data, so all the measurement result can be traced back;2. Accutension can show the visual trend of blood pressure on daily, weekly, monthly and yearly basis.Start to get accurate blood pressure readings now.";"Shanghai Hulu Devices Co Ltd";0;"1.0.7";1528934400

"131";4,8;"Social Networking";12;"Avalon is a safe, private, and secure alternative to today’s social media. Avalon began as a global research project studying how to make a positive difference in human communication. It was coordinated across six continents representing all cultures, investigating commonalities in human behavior.As we know, social media in its current form has not had a lasting positive effect on the majority of people. But why is that? We all use it, we desire to share.We believe the reach of social media is important and here to stay, but probably not in its current form, function or implementations. Our goal was to make a fundamental change in social media for the betterment of all. Avalon was born.We all desire the same things: honesty, understanding, and to be accepted. Avalon is the only service designed to make it easy for you to communicate in that way. But like anything else, it needs you. If you want to make a change or just get a long-needed break from all the constant social noise on every communication channel, please come join us and bring your friends. Together we can build the connected world we all want.Although Avalon looks very simple, it is a highly sophisticated system that models real human communication and awareness. It is based in the most current findings in neuroscience, computer architecture, and human-machine interface design. It has been used at top medical facilities and in a host of other applications.Unlike other technology companies, we understand that your primary objective is to authentically connect with with people on the other side of your communications. The uniqueness of Avalon is that you can do everything you normally enjoy on any other social network, minus the unwanted interruptions and soapbox tangents. Avalon has the one ingredient all other social media lacks, the ability to build deeper relationships while extending your thoughts and emotions through the internet.After years of being in development and in use in closed applications, we decided it was the right time to offer Avalon to the general public. We feel we have created the best environment where you can reach those who are important to you and also develop a better understanding of yourself.People that use Avalon say that it’s a calming oasis. And it’s true. This is not marketing hype or a hook for a sinister business model that profits off your information. These are real users and what they experience.Of course, we want everyone on Avalon to have fun, explore, and reach as many people as they can. The difference is, now you’ll know what people are thinking and when they thought it. And for the first time, you may also understand how they feel about themselves. Avalon will be evolving to do things that before were only the promises of science fiction. It’s going to be an amazing journey for you and us, so get aboard and let’s travel to that new destination together.Lastly, we are a small company with a big vision. Our work is highly respected around the world but we need your involvement to influence history unfolding for the better. Certainly it will be an evolutionary step in human communication for individuals and businesses.For more information, please see www.avalon.social.

Eat fewer calories than you use during the day and you'll lose weight. Add in exercise and you may also be able to improve your body composition, since the exercise will help you maintain your muscle so you lose mostly fat.Lower Blood PressureWeight loss may help you lower your blood pressure levels, according to a study published in ""Diabetes Care"" in July 2011. Although improvements were greater in people who lost more weight, even those losing just 2 to 5 percent of their weight were more likely experience improvements in systolic blood pressure.Improved MoodNot only will you look better, but you may also feel better if you lose weight. Studies performed using participants of the National Weight Control Registry have found that weight loss may also lead to improvements in mood.Higher Energy LevelsThe National Weight Control Registry studies also noted that people who have lost weight tend to have more energy.

It is like a happiness and vitality pill with no negative side effects.But how does it work? BodyBrainDance, a movement system that has been created and developed for 30 years, uniquely engages both small and big parts of your body, while playing with different speeds of movement and intensity levels. That leads to feeling more active and alive.BodyBrainDance has been taught under the name “Stopping Movement” to more than 500 groups of participants, and it has been used by them to:Release mental and physical stressWhile BodyBrainDancing, your mind gets in a state where it is primarily aware of the sensation of your body moving. The combination of movement and focused awareness leads to relaxation and stress release.Protect muscles and jointsBodyBrainDance activates muscles and joints you do not normally use. Since injuries and chronic pains often come from repetitive movements, you are now protecting yourself while exercising AND having fun.While practicing BodyBrainDance for a few minutes per day, you can experience these benefits:Physically, you will be able to move with agility, balance and suppleness, become stronger, with healthier muscle tone and stamina, and experience increased circulation, fewer aches and discomforts.Mentally, you will be able to focus, problem-solve and remember better, reduce the “internal noise” and control your internal dialog, and experience everyday life mindfully.Emotionally, you will be able to transform a bad mood into joyful emotions, experience less stress and feel more centered while feeling calmer, joyful and caring.In 2018, we decided to make the system available to ANYONE, ANYWHERE, ANYTIME!With the support of the original developers of the system and many of the system’s instructors worldwide, we developed the BodyBrainDance mobile app, which teaches you the basic principles of the system.You create a customized BodyBrainDance session in seconds, using especially composed and produced dance music that was created specifically for the app – so you can get the most out of your session.All you need to do is choose:The duration of the session (15/30/45/60 minutes)The maximum speed/intensity of the music (slow/medium/fast)One of the four build-ups of the sessions (steady/slow-to-fast/random/wave) andClick on “create session”.The BodyBrainDance app does the rest…Are you ready to join the movement?";"Open Circles Academy S.L.";0,99;NA;NA

"253";NA;"Medical";17;"An interactive tool to help estimate a woman's risk of developing breast cancer. This tool is based on a statistical model known as the ""Gail model,"" which is named after Dr. Mitchell Gail, Senior Investigator in the Biostatistics Branch of NCI's Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics.The Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool is an interactive tool designed by scientists at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) to estimate a woman's risk of developing invasive breast cancer. The tool has been updated for African American women based on the Contraceptive and Reproductive Experiences (CARE) Study. See About the Tool for more information.Before using the tool, please note the following:    * The Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool was designed for use by health professionals. If you are not a health professional, you are encouraged to discuss the results and your personal risk of breast cancer with your doctor.    * The tool should not be used to calculate breast cancer risk for women who have already had a diagnosis of breast cancer, lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS), or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).    * The BCRA risk calculator may be updated periodically as new data or research becomes available.    * Although the tool has been used with success in clinics for women with strong family histories of breast cancer, more specific methods of estimating risk are appropriate for women known to have breast cancer-producing mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes.    * Other factors may also affect risk and are not accounted for by the tool. These factors include previous radiation therapy to the chest for the treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma or recent migration from a region with low breast cancer rates, such as rural China. The tool's risk calculations assume that a woman is screened for breast cancer as in the general U.S. population. A woman who does not have mammograms will have somewhat lower chances of a diagnosis of breast cancer.";"YEH TSUNG MING";2,99;"1.6";1517961600

Feel better right away with the easy, enjoyable Meditation Oasis® Breathe & Relax app. It will help you develop the habit of breathing in a natural, relaxed way throughout the day.  Experience stress relief, relaxation and more energy with three simple tools:1 - BREATHING EXERCISE -- This simple voice-guided exercise will help you learn to breath in a natural, easy way. Instead of a complicated exercise in which you have to count, pause, or breathe in a particular way, this exercise uses an intuitive approach. It guides you to tune into your body and discover your own, natural way of breathing. The exercise is pleasurable to do and you'll look forward to doing it rather than feeling it's a chore. 2 - FOUR BREATHING BREAK AUDIOS -- These audios are designed for brief breathing breaks during the day. There are four to choose from, each with a different focus -- Basic Breath Awareness,  Deep Breathing, Pleasure Breathing, and Belly Breathing. 3 - BREATHING REMINDERS -- Do you ever notice that you hold your breath when you're concentrating on something or feeling stressed? It's very common! Our muscles tense when stressed and our breathing becomes constricted or even stops. All it takes is a simple reminder to get you to relax and breathe more deeply. You can choose when you wish to be reminded, and choose from voice prompts, sounds or use the silent mode and receive visual reminders only. *****************************Created by Mary Maddux, MS, HTP and Richard Maddux, best known for their popular Meditation Oasis podcast and CDs.

"271";NA;"Medical";12;"CALCIVIS imaging system-visualising the invisible to enable preventive dentistry. Introducing the concept behind the CALCIVIS imaging system, this short animation shows how the CALCIVIS imaging system applies CALCIVIS photoprotein which, in the presence of free calcium ions, produces a very short, low level light flash. An integrated intraoral sensor within the CALCIVIS imaging device immediately detects the luminescence (light flash) and presents clinicians with a chair side demineralization image for discussion with patients.Calcium ions, in fluid filled enamel pores, act as markers of active demineralisation, regardless of cause (‘early’, none, or micro-cavitated caries or erosive).  Visualising these free calcium ions is the CALCIVIS key to unlocking minimal intervention approaches and motivating patient engagement meaning that when identified early, non-cavitated active enamel demineralisation can be “healed” with oral health advice and simple topical treatments.CALCIVIS photoprotein is a first for dentistry: a dental biologic which produces light exclusively as a reaction to the presence of free calcium ions released from actively demineralising tooth surfaces such as those associated with caries or erosion. When CALCIVIS photoprotein contacts free calcium ions, such as those found on actively demineralising tooth surfaces, a very short, low-level flash of light (luminescence) is created which is undetectable by the naked eye. Luminescence is different to fluorescence: the reflection of a light by a substance that has had another light energy shone on it.Unique to CALCIVIS imaging system the resulting luminescence occurs only in the presence of free calcium (bound calcium in sound enamel does not generate the light signal) meaning that CALCIVIS delivers a predictable result with low or no false positives. CALCIVIS imaging device is a specialised device designed exclusively to image the tooth surface after delivering a metered application of CALCIVIS photoprotein. Initiated via a “one touch” computer controlled process, a specialized sensor integrated into the device immediately detects the resulting luminescence (light flash). In less than 1 second, bespoke software presents a chair side demineralization “hot-spot” image map to clinicians, enabling informed and efficient dialogue with patients.CALCIVIS imaging system supports the preventive dentistry approach by enabling minimal intervention decision-making, improved patient motivation and compliance in caries management and associated enamel demineralization conditions.";"Immersive VR Ltd";0;NA;NA

They are often caused by other health complications or result in other illnesses and risks. It is for that reason, that we have included separate guidelines for those who might be at risk with any of the following common conditions along with Cervical Cancer: depression, gout, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity, stress and Vitamin D deficiency. Also included are separate guidelines for detoxification, and anti-inflammation & alkaline diets.• Top-5 recommendations on what to eat/do, and what not to.• Food Suggestions.

Chakras are energy centers located through your physical body; the most important ones are 7, and they influence your life flow.In order to live a balanced life, you must maintain your Chakras in constant balance. When one of them is closed, the others will compensate by opening up more and this will create unbalance in your body, as well as unbalance in your spirit.How to Balance your Chakras?Each Chakra is associated with different colors and different sounds. Certain stones can tune your Chakras and allow energy to flow through them.The same can be done with certain wave frequencies. Chakra Meditation was devised and studied to help you tune your Chakras through meditation. Just tap once the buttons and a soft tune related to that Chakra will start. Tap again to stop it.We put a lot of passion in creating this app, and decided to make it FREE so that everyone can enjoy it and use it to improve their spiritual life.For a better experience and to truly enjoy the high quality of the music, we recommend using headphones instead of speakers.*Chakra Meditation Includes*- 7 HIGH QUALITY tunes, specifically created for each of the 7 most important Chakras- A detailed information page on each of the Chakras, useful to remind what energy centers of the body they influence, their location and their name.- The screen will change color once you select a specific Chakra, aiding you in your meditation.- High definition background, created for iPad Retina display but available on all Apple devices.- For a brief overview of how to use the App, just tap the Question button on the lower right side of the screen for help.Here are some reviews for Chakra Meditation Balancing:••••• This app has literally and figuratively assisted in changing my perspective on life!

"377";NA;"Health & Fitness";4;"Everyone carries a light within that is valuable and whose essence is the stuff of epic and heroic legends. We all have a hero lurking inside us, incognito. This app is dedicated to all those who want to overcome their anxiety and are seekers of peace, resilience and courage. It is created for those who wish to learn more about that lionhearted individual residing deep within them that wants to come forth to do what is good. It is a guide to a service mindset so that victimization, self-pity, hatred, and doubt can be exposed for what they are—imposters trying to sabotage the real hero within all of us.  In this app, “Couragekeepers: Uncovering the Hero Within,” Debra Norwood, an attorney-peacebuilder, certified laughter leader—expert level, and certified brain health coach has gathered information from various disciplines such as positive psychology, neuroscience, therapeutic humor and laughter, and mindfulness and meditation, in order to create a self-help tool to foster resilience.  She directs the user to her favorite expert resources, authors, and personal experiences to provide not only a quick reference guide to principles about courage and wellbeing, but also to empower the user with self-sufficiency, accountability, and a service mindset, all explored through personal journaling.Why journaling? Studies have shown that documenting positive experiences can help the brain combat negative thoughts and their physical reactions to them. Prompts in the app also encourage engagement in many other brain healthy habits including joining a community of other Couragekeepers to share experiences and to meet others who have overcome adversity and found meaning as helpers and healers in this world.Through this app, users will experience personal growth by exploring their character strengths, optimism, understanding, ability to reinvigorate themselves, act in altruism, and show grit and empathy in order to uncover the hero within them.  By journaling some of these basic building blocks for inner peace, users reinforce their own self-worth and tap into a wealth of information about what the world needs most today—COURAGE!For a list of resources and to meet other Couragekeepers, follow us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram @Couragekeepers.

"396";NA;"Medical";4;"OVERVIEW:  The CURO Human app is designed for Clinicians and Physical Trainers and works together with a MyoDynamik CURO system to record muscle contractions during periods of physical activity.BACKGROUND: Acoustic Myography (AMG) (also known as phonomyography, sound myography, vibromyography, and surface mechanomyogram) is a technique that measures the low frequency sounds (1 Hz to 200 Hz) created during muscular activity – sounds that can often be heard with ones ear pressed up against a contracting muscle.CLINICIANS:  can use this tool to help them locate and assess a muscle related injury. Our CURO system and purpose built sensors are capable of accurately recording the contractions made by active muscles – no need to shave or prepare your subject.PHYSICAL TRAINERS:  can use the CURO to better assess a subject’s strength, endurance, efficiency and coordination as well as better identify muscle injuries and follow their recovery.- Simply select the muscle/muscles of interest using our app- Rub in our acoustic gel to ensure good acoustic contact with the skin- Place our sensor on the gel - Tape the sensor in place with the bandage provided- Connect the sensor to the CURO- Activate the CURO and establish a WiFi link with our app- Start recording in real-timeThe applications for which the CURO has been tested include:- Muscle imbalance assessment – examining gait issues- Muscle disease or wasting assessment- Muscle performance assessment – following a re-training program- Muscle fatigue assessmentThe CURO system not only presents muscle sounds in real-time it also provides a real-time balance score to enable you to detect muscle imbalances with the aid of our unique ESTiTM Score. AMG-measurements are sent to an iPad so you can immediately see how your muscles function.ESTi TM INTERPRETATION:  The CURO system is unique in that it measures the number of active fibers (spatial summation; S) and the frequency with which they contract (temporal summation; T) as well as the way in which the Central Nervous System (CNS) recruits and uses the active fibers in a muscle (synchrony/efficiency; E). It is only by combining the timing aspect of muscle fiber contraction that one can start to assess the synchrony with which the CNS recruits active fibers in a muscle – and in so doing, more accurately determine the significance of both the signal amplitude and frequency.E - Efficiency:  the E-parameter refers to the period of muscle fiber activity during a recorded period of exercise – muscle efficiency. A high score obtained during moderate to high levels of exercise is a sign of a very well trained and highly coordinated / efficient muscle movement.S – Spatial summation:  the S-parameter refers to the number of muscle fibers recruited during a movement, as part of exercise or a muscle contraction. A low score obtained during moderate to high levels of exercise is a sign of a very well trained and highly coordinated muscle movement.T – Temporal summation:  the T-parameter refers to the speed with which muscle fibers are activated repeatedly during a movement, as part of exercise or a muscle contraction. A low score obtained during moderate to high levels of exercise is a sign of a very well trained and highly coordinated muscle movement.In addition to these individual scores, the CURO system calculates the ESTi Balance for muscle groups – allowing the user to quickly assess muscle imbalances in the body that could give rise to lameness or early fatigue and muscle soreness.ESTi Balance:  	   ± 10% from ZERO = MILD IMBALANCE                           ± 20% from ZERO = MODERATE IMBALANCE                           > ± 20% from ZERO = SERIOUS IMBALANCE";"MyoDynamik ApS";0;"1.1";1465430400

The application features over 100 muscles with trigger points and referral patterns, and for every muscle there is a detailed description of function, anatomy and innervation in word and graphics. Dry needling is the use of a solid needle for therapy of muscle pain (myofascial pain). Dry needling contrasts with the use of a hollow needle to inject substances. Such use of a solid needle has been found to be as effective as injection of substances in such cases as relief of pain in muscles and connective tissue. Acupuncture and dry needling techniques may be similar, but their rationale and use in treatment are quite different.The application is based on the important work of Dr. Janet Travell.Dr. Janet Travell was an expert on myofascial pain - a term used to describe pain and dysfunction of skeletal muscles - and pioneered numerous techniques for dealing with chronic pain. Dr. Travell co-authored, with David Simons, the acclaimed two-volume book Myofascial Pain and Dysfunction: The Trigger Point Manual. (Volume 1 was published in 1983 and dealt with the upper half of body, volume 2 was published in 1992 and dealt with the lower half.) Dr. Travell served as Associate (and later Emeritus) Clinical Professor of Medicine at The George Washington University, and remained an active figure up until her death at the age of ninety-five, writing, giving lectures, and attending conferences.The application is easy to use and a quick help in finding the most important muscle(s) responsible for your patient's pain; a usefull guide in your daily ""myofascial pain"" practice.

You can also use Ear Machine to listen to songs/podcasts in your music library. State of the Art Signal ProcessingThe signal processing in Ear Machine is similar to what is used in most hearing instruments. A wide-dynamic range multiband compressor ensures that quiet sounds are amplified,  while protecting you from sounds that are already loud. A multiband limiter provides further protection from loud sounds. An expander makes sure that very quiet sounds (e.g., refrigerator hum) are not annoying. You can even use Ear Machine as a sound level meter (works best with phone microphone).";"Ear Machine LLC";0;"1.2.2";1485129600

"521";3,9;"Health & Fitness";4;"As featured on NPR's ""All Tech Considered"" - 12th March 2013""It's a great timer with super extras. I recommend it highly.""  - TUAW Review, 26th July 2010Note: This version is iOS7 compatible. A free update with upgraded design is coming soon.Equanimity has been very carefully designed to help you establish and maintain a daily meditation practice.The elegant meditation timer times your sittings, provides a beautiful journal for sitting notes, and displays graphical tracking giving you clear feedback on your meditation practice. It's carefully designed to be the ideal companion for anyone who meditates.The journal is comparable in quality to many standalone note-taking apps. It allows you to optionally take notes after your sittings, and lets you browse through your meditation history as either a visually annotated log or textual journal. All of your recorded data can be exported, as a nicely formatted email that you can print, or as a table that you can load into a spreadsheet. You can also email individual entries - useful for posting them on a blog.Easy to read graphics let you know at a glance how regularly you are meditating, and how long your daily practice has been going. A chart illustrates your progress over the course of the year, and a bar graph shows the total number of hours you have meditated. To remind you if you forget to sit, the application icon optionally counts the number of days since you last meditated. It's much easier to keep going with a routine when you can see so clearly how you are doing.The timer shows time passing using clean graphics that let you see at a glance where you are within your sitting period without being unduly distracted.If your meditation routine incorporates different stages within a single sitting, you can set chimes to ring at the appropriate points using straightforward controls.You can turn off the ringer and the gongs will still sound, so you don't need to worry about being interrupted by phone calls or SMS. If you need to attend to a message briefly, you can carry on from where you left off.  For people whose meditation practice involves chants or prayer, you can also switch to other apps and the timer will still run and the chimes will still ring.Because the timer is intended to be used every day, the design provides a calm and clear experience without unnecessary clutter.This application has helped me to make meditation a daily practice, and I hope it can do the same for you.Customer Service: if you are considering leaving a poor review, please contact me to see if I can help you first. I reply to every single customer email.Features:• Icon Badge reminders - counts the days since you last sat. (IOS 4) (NEW)• Works in background on devices that support multitasking. (NEW)• Easily log meditations not timed using your iPhone (at a class or retreat etc). (NEW)• Swipe to delete existing log entries.

"541";NA;"Medical";4;"This app is a test to measure reaction times in vision. The user starts the test by pressing the tab 'Start Trial'. After this tab is pressed, a visual stimulus is presented. The visual stimulus is made of black or white squares embedded in a noisy background. The user has to count as fast as possible the number of squares and press a tab with the correct number, which can be 1, 2 or 3. Once a tab is pressed, another stimulus appears and this sequence is repeated until the user stops the test. A minimum number of trials (200) is required to obtain reliable data, however, the user can finish the test at any time by pressing 'End Trial'. When 'End Trial' is pressed, the user can see the average reaction time (e.g. 'Mean White RT: 0.739 seconds', 'Mean Black RT: 0.723 seconds') and the accuracy of the visual performance (e.g. 'White percent of correct answers: 88.7%', 'Black percent of correct answers: 89.1%'). When 200 trials are completed, there is an option to mail the data to our laboratory and to the user's email address. The data will be mailed in the form of a data sheet that contains information about the data collected (e.g. reaction times and correct responses for individual trials) and information about the variables selected for the test. The variables can be set before the test begins (e.g. size of noise, size of targets, ratio of black and white area, number of trials). After the data is mailed, the app provides a score of performance based on the speed and accuracy of the count. The score ranges from 0 to 100 (100 being best performance).This visual test was inspired by published work from the laboratories of Drs. Jose Manuel Alonso and Qasim Zaidi  (Komban et al., 2011, 2014; Wool et al, 2015). The app was written by Vandad Davoodnia as part of a collaboration between the laboratories of Dr. Reza Lashgari and Dr. Jose Manuel Alonso. The purpose of this app is to provide eye doctors with a tool for vision research. Collecting data with this app could also help to improve current visual tests and/or develop new tests that can be used to monitor the progression of a visual disease.    References1) Komban, S.

Skin care, therefore, assumes great significance, both in terms of aesthetics, as well as in contributing to a social persona. We often attribute a person with good skin as someone who is healthy, both in mind and spirit. And mind you, when  we  talk  of  good  skin  here,  we  do  not  talk  about  skin  that  has  been camouflaged  by  layers  of  concealers  and  foundations.  Naturally  healthy  skin that shines with smoothness, softness and vitality typifies a person who is lucky in terms of genetic inheritance and takes an obvious effort to preserve it. Taking  care  of  your  facial  skin  assumes  more  significance  since  it  is  your ‘projected self’ to the world.

The Fear Eraser contained within not only removes fear in the moment, but in most cases you will actually be unable to bring back the fear even if you tried hard to. In most people it works so quickly that it can easily be purchased and used at the airport just prior to a flight or even on the flight.In our opinion this technique leaves all other ""fear of flying"" methods in the dust in terms of speed, reliability and ease of use. As far as we are aware no other fear of flying method can provide video evidence of fearful flyers being terrified one moment and the next they are shock when they aren't able to think about flying in the same way.The video can be seen here: www.flyandbecalm.co.uk along with further information about how this works so effectively. When the technique is purchased via the website for the desktop download, we offer a money back guarantee - if after one week there isn't a substantial reduction in fear when thinking about flying you can have your money back. We offer the product here at a cheaper price because for operational and technical reasons, giving refunds is more complex via APP stores.We are confident that brief use of this product will make you a calm and happy flyer far quicker than you would imagine.

Food For Me is a flexible and simple way to keep a list of foods that you enjoy. We take the guesswork out of food choices. This is a menu centered completely around YOUR personal guidelines and preferences.In the beginning, your menu is completely blank. For any food item or meal that you want to include in your menu, “Add New” to include that food in your food list. When you add that food item, you may note any nutrition facts that are important for you to track. Don’t know calories, but do know protein content? That’s fine. Enter what you know and update any other nutrition information you want to track later. Also, tell Food For Me whether this is a food from Home or from a particular restaurant. There is also plenty of room in the description field for you to note any changes you make to that food item when you order it or when you prepare it (i.e. chicken only, no sauce). Finally, you may also identify when you typically eat this food …. snack, lunch, pre-workout snack, anytime, etc.That’s it! Now Food For Me adds that item to your customized menu. As you continue to add food items, your customized menu becomes more and more valuable.Trying to think of a snack that sounds good and that has 100-200 calories? Enter those search criteria and allow Food For Me to display a list of foods where each food listed is a food you like and a food that meets any particular dietary restrictions you might have! The power of Food For Me comes in your ability to enter information that makes sense to you and to retrieve that information in a way that shows food choices designed specifically for you.Wouldn’t it be great to look at a menu filled ONLY with food that you CAN eat?

If you’ve repeatedly tried and failed to lose weight and keep it off using the countless diet programs out there it’s because conventional diets just don’t work.  Changing your eating patterns requires changing the impulsive behaviors or habits that are driving your eating and willpower alone is not enough.  GoalsBooster is based on the following 3 pillars of sustainable change needed to achieve your goals:1.	Form goal-directed habits.2.	Boost your motivation 3. 	And a goal based approach.The most effective strategy to achieve your health goals it to form goal-directed habits.  That means changing your bad habits and forming the good habits you need to achieve your goals.  The reason that forming goal-directed habits is key to sustainable change is because once you form good habits your goal directed behaviors become automatic.  So you don’t have to depend on willpower which gets weak just when we need it the most.  Like when we’re feeling stressed or upset which is unfortunately just when we’re most vulnerable to self-destructive coping behaviors like unhealthy eating.  Our GoalsBooster exercises will help you form goal-directed habits and boost your motivation using strategies that have proven incredibly effective in helping people change their behavior.Our program is based on an incremental goal based approach to help you gradually transition to a healthy diet.  Using goals for accountability will help you stay motivated  and we'll be monitoring your goal progress and will send you daily motivational messages.

"659";NA;"Utilities";12;"The application displays the data from the device Stress Meter, which measures the galvanic skin response of the human body, as well as data recorded during therapy or training sessions, to the application via a local area network.Skin conductance, also known as galvanic skin response (GSR), electrodermal response (EDR), psychogalvanic reflex (PGR), skin conductance response (SCR) or skin conductance level (SCL), is a method of measuring the electrical conductance of the skin, which varies with its moisture level. This is of interest because the sweat glands are controlled by the sympathetic nervous system, so skin conductance is used as an indication of psychological or physiological arousal. Therefore, if the sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system is highly aroused, then sweat gland activity will also increase, which in turn increases skin conductance. In this way, skin conductance can be used as a measure of emotional and sympathetic responses.There has been a long history of electrodermal activity research, most of it dealing with spontaneous fluctuations or reactions to stimuli. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galvanic_skin_response";"Mikhail Fedorov";0;"2.4";1442448000

Every tee, fairway and green are as one with the undulating landscape of this exceptional moorland location.Wildlife is in abundance – Deer, Foxes, Badgers and many species of birds choose here as their home.The layout has remained true to its original design with the only major alterations being made by Dr Alistair McKenzie in 1912. Dr McKenzie went on to design some of the greatest courses in the world including the Augusta National, home of the US Masters in partnership with the legendary Bobby Jones. Ogden’s design credentials are therefore second to none.Over recent years, the links have been extensively improved. Most of the tees have been extended and relaid, abandoned bunkers from the early days have been re-introduced and paths and bridges developed to meet the standards expected by today’s golfer. Today, the greens are widely regarded as being amongst the best in Yorkshire.Ogden provides a great challenge for even the best shot maker. Eleven of the holes feature water hazards, often nestling in the bottom of steep gullies which can gather your ball as naturally and easily as any seaside bunker. Each hole at Ogden is quite different from the last making it a course which will stand out in your memory long after you have enjoyed its unique delights.For the Golfers, the app features the Whole in One Golf GPS Range Finder and Digital Guide to playing the 18 Hole Championship Course.

Headz Up! provides an extra measure of safety for those who may not come in contact with people during an activity they are engaged in (for ex., off road cycling). It does this by the following:• Sending a text alert to an identified emergency contact indicating that the user has not moved in a set number of minutes. The set number of minutes is selected by the user.• Providing the emergency contact with a map view that displays the GPS location of the non-moving user.• In the event the user begins moving again, Headz Up! will send a follow up message to the emergency contact indicating that the user has begun moving again.While the app can be downloaded at no charge, use of the app as designed requires purchasing an annual subscription. This is because the app relies on a third party to send the emergency alerts (since they are not initiated by the user), and therefore creates charges based on use.";"Peacock Expressions, LLC";0;"1.7";1488326400

"692";NA;"Medical";17;"This easy-to-use all-in-one App helps you to record any blood test results or health figures that you wish to monitor, and any symptoms that trouble you. The results are displayed as clear tables with succinct information, simple graphs and calendars that everyone can understand. It differs from other similar Apps in that you can record both numeric and subjective health data in a single App. It also allows you to define what you want to record (in-app purchase needed), and change it later if you so wish. A British family doctor developed this App initially for his own patients. He found most patients come to consult with symptoms that have often lasted for weeks if not months. If the frequency, severity and associated circumstances are clearly mapped it will help with the diagnosis tremendously. A good medical history can avoid much unnecessary investigations and quickens the diagnosis. Most patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension will have the habit of charting their blood sugar and blood pressure. However, to be an effective monitoring it is also necessary to record related problems such as cholesterol and kidney functions. This App allows you to do that. There are also patients with other medical conditions that need regular blood test monitoring such as measuring uric acid level in gout, and INR in those taking blood thinning medicines. This App will help those patients too. Many well patients have turned this App into a keep-fit tool, charting body weight, BMI and waist circumference.This App is meant to be simple. Decide what you want to record and off you go. No fancy statistics, just key information that your doctor wants to know. Clear graphs and diagrams are often more informative in clinical decision-making.On the technical side, the App can do:-	Adding free text remarks by typing or speech-	Remarks are flagged in the graphs and can be opened-	Data entered at a later time can be shifted back to the time of the episode-	Data entered with error can be deleted-	Normal range values and units can be changed to suit different labs -	Alarm clock function (date and time)-	Alerts when you figure is outside normal range-	Hot key to call your doctor/therapist (user defined phone number) when alert appears the third time-	Abnormal values appear in red and can be easily distinguished from other entries on the List-	Values entered by error can be deleted from List-	Line graph can be scrolled or stretched along the time axisWith in-app purchase you can-	Record two numeric tests and two symptoms at the same time, as well as blood pressure.-	Can define your own tests or symptoms";"Shia Tsai Wei";0;NA;NA

"823";NA;"Health & Fitness";4;"Have you ever woken up with a toothache? If so, you know it can be unbearable. That is why we have developed Kare. When you are in pain do you want to have to call every dentist you can find in the phone book or on a Google search to see if they are open? If you find an office that is open, will they see you today? Do they take your insurance? You may be searching for hours, which is not very convenient for you. Or is it that you have trouble taking off work to go to appointments? Traditionally patients have to work around the dentist's schedule. It becomes difficult when you work the same hours that the dentist office is open.Kare solves those problems and more. By logging into the application on your smartphone or tablet at any time of the day or night and entering simple information about yourself, you can perform a GPS search which will provide you with a list of dentists that are open, have immediate availability, and accept your insurance within your geographical location. You can select which dentist you want to connect with and within a few clicks you have an instant appointment scheduled. No more wasting time searching for a dentist.Are you one of the millions of people on either Medicaid or Medicare? When you call the list of providers who accept your insurance have you ever been amazed to hear that it will be three months or longer before you can get in for routine care? A lot can happen in three months. Often patients end up in pain in the ER. All the doctors in the ER will be able to do is give you some medication. What you need is to see a dentist ASAP. Kare helps you get treatment same day. From scheduling cleanings and exams to fillings, root canals, and extractions, Kare can be of assistance 24 hours a day.Have you ever actually finally made it into a dental appointment, but then the dentist wasn’t able to do the procedure you needed? We don’t want you to be in discomfort for any longer than is necessary. That is why Kare’s algorithm matches patient to provider based on the requested procedure in addition to location and availability. If you are not sure what kind of treatment you need, a Kare staff dentist is available 24 hours a day to video chat with you for only $19.99.How is all this possible? How does it work? Well, every day dentists have patients that cancel their appointments last minute or do not show. This leaves openings in their schedule that they are not able to foresee. With Kare, they can log on and mark their availability. This tells Kare to add them to the list of dentists that appear when a patient searches for a provider.";"Kare Mobile Inc.";0;"1.0.1";1534896000

"843";NA;"Medical";4;"Introduction to Antibiotics in the Physician’s Pocket (APP)Thank you for visiting APP. We welcome you on behalf of all the members of Korean Society for Chemotherapy. To briefly introduce, APP is an application/website guide on the use of antibiotics that was created and provided by the Korean Society for Chemotherapy. Recently, numerous guidelines have been created. Currently there are about 2,800 guidelines registered on the Guidelines International Network and about 2,400 guidelines registered on the National Guideline Clearinghouse. We believe that in order for a guideline to become a good guideline it must be trustworthy, regularly updated, have widespread distribution, and be user friendly for clinicians. The Korean Society for Chemotherapy has therefore decided to create and provide a guideline that is based on an application/website. For this antibiotics application, we used the domestic guidelines (Korean practice guidelines) as the basis, configured the application with doctors of non-infectious diseases as its main target audience, and purposed it to be a clinical decision support system application that helps doctors make appropriate antibiotic prescriptions. Furthermore, we have formulated the application to be usable by anyone (open access), be simultaneously operational on both the application and the website (hybrid display), and have linked this application to the PK/PD application which contains the more professional antibiotics information (linkage with PK/PD app).    References used in the content development include 14 Korean guidelines, 35 American guidelines, 5 European guidelines, 4 miscellaneous guidelines that include WHO, 44 theses, and Mandell and Harrison textbooks. FDA fact sheet or the pharmacist’s package insert were referred to for antibiotics content development, and links to Medscape were set up for adverse reactions and drug interactions content.We have briefly summarized the content as much as possible in order to induce easy usage. However, due to this decision there were limitations in including a more detailed content. Moreover, another deficiency is that because there are only a small number of guidelines available about children, the content of the application is mainly only about adults.

Designed by a psychiatrist with more than 30 years of experience treating ADD/ADHD, MedOptimizer™ is the only proactive ADHD app created specifically for parents struggling to find the best-fit treatment plan for their children. The Challenges:• All children with ADD/ADHD are NOT the same. They differ in the specific types and severity of their symptoms, the times of day they suffer symptoms most intensely, and their responses to stimulant and non-stimulant ADHD medications. • All ADHD medications are NOT the same.  They differ in how long they last, how quickly they begin working, and in the types of symptoms they are most effective in treating. • Physicians need MORE data. Finding the best plan is largely dependent on the amount, type, and accuracy of information a physician receives during the limited time allotted for an appointment that may only occur every 1 to 2 months.  Most parents aren’t clear on the specific data they should record or how often and don’t have a quick and easy way to record it.The Solution:MedOptimizer™ ADD/ADHD for Parents provides you with a fast and reliable way to record the specific type and amount of data at the required frequency your physician needs to create an individually customized and thus more effective medication treatment plan for your child.  Simply put, find the Right Medication at the Right Dose at the Right Times for your unique child.  Get Ready•  We know parents are busy people so we created quick and easy menus to record any medications and doses your child is currently taking.•  Record a “base-line” rating of 9 symptoms your child experienced before medication so MedOptimizer™ can measure the effectiveness of current or future medication(s).

"982";NA;"Health & Fitness";4;"ITALIAN SPORTS CENTRE – COMMITTEE OF MODENAThe generative idea of the Italian Sports Centre is to invest in culture, education and  services through games, sports and movement. The “single person” is the heart of the ICS project (Italian Sports Centre – CSI – Centro Sportivo Italiano): through a well devised and a more and more complete service network our Association wants to make itself available for a path accompanying the “single person” throughout his/her life.With such a premise we could not help collaborate enthusiastically to the development of a project for movement involving aggregation, relationships, health, welfare, tourism and culture in a sports mix.MUOVIMO IS A “SERIOUS GAME”MuoviMo is a digital application belonging to the category of “serious games” for being healthy.The serious games for being healthy are needed in order to get positive results in terms of behavioural change and learning, and they are “games” that, in digital format and on mobile devices, have different ways of approach between playful and educational. Their main feature is that entertainment is the medium through which people are educated and guided to learn certain information so as to provide them with the adequate motivation to adopt a certain kind of behaviour.MuoviMo is a serious game concerning the promotion of physical exercise for being healthy and how to keep off, in the long run, some chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes and prevent complications.MuoviMo can help doctors, as the simple exchange of information between them and their patients is not often enough to convince people to modify their behaviour.MUOVIMO IS A SMART CITY PROJECTMuoviMo is a project of active tourism for a city promoting good health, and it is a smart city project to promote urban trekking, fast walk or slow run, on the best track in the historic centre of Modena. It is meant for every single person and for spontaneous dynamic walking parties who are homogeneous in their pace speed.The app is an on-line navigator (not satellite) made up of a sequence of pictures with which you can visit  the historic city at your own speed for the best of your health. You will follow a well defined itinerary associating slow physical exercise to the discovery of works of art, sights, less known historic places lived by residents. There are pictures and descriptions (audiovisual too) of all the buildings of some artistic, cultural and historical interest on the track. The project aims to make of the city centre an open air gym for everyone at any given moment during the day and all year round.MuoviMo is also an informative campaign applying the “global recommendations on physical activity for good health of the World Health Organisation (WHO)”. It is therefore an application to improve your health just with physical exercise at moderate intensity (fast walk or slow run).MuoviMo is a real smart city project, a new genre of common welfare, as it creates a “dialogue” between people and the city. Information are integrated generating intelligence and producing social inclusion. It is for this reason that we have called the circular track in the city centre pedestrians’ urban caravan: a new technological and immaterial infrastructure where you go to play a game with the intake of healthy movement “pills” to move on from facebook to shaking hands with people.Events such as theatre or music performances are also organised on the track.  Exhibitions, shows and product tastings at 0 Km are  part of the project too. We can do trains of healthy walking parties but also organise reading groups,  or groups to contrast alcoholism and nicotine addiction, or for good food nutrition.MuoviMo is substantially a regularity game to keep healthy through the “intake”, during your daily routine, of short breaks of slow movement in the historic centre of Modena.";"COSTRUIRE in Project s.r.l.";0;"2.0.6";1486339200

In this highly interactive course Professor Barkhof and colleagues discuss the need for novel approaches to disease activity assessment in patients with relapse-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) undergoing therapy with disease-modifying drugs, and review the evidence base supporting the efficacy of current/emerging therapies in achieving NEDA. Based on their own practical experience, the expert faculty review the latest publications in the field and discuss how novel measures of disease activity, such as NEDA-3 and NEDA-4, can be used in clinical studies to determine those therapies that may have the greatest potential to ameliorate disease progression and enhance patient outcomes.This course has been awarded 1 European CME credit (ECMEC) by the European Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (EACCME). Developed by faculty to support physicians in understanding the concept of treating to a target of NEDA in multiple sclerosis and its potential clinical applications, this 1-hour course utilizes a blend of interactive formats and videos to facilitate and reinforce learning.

"1039";4,5;"Health & Fitness";4;"Featured in ""BEST MOBILE APPS"" - Portrait Health Publishing.My.Walk.Run is a fun and easy app for tracking your walking, hiking, jogging or running activities and you can post your results to Facebook.My.Walk.Run is NOT a pedometer.  It does not count steps.  It is a GPS-based app that calculates your distance and speed using your change in location.  It is designed for outdoor use.It provides advantages over most other GPS fitness apps: 1. Easier to use with an auto-pause feature, 2. An auto GPS shut-off battery saver, 3. Can get you “Back on Time” or “Back by Dark”, and 4. Easy to share your route map and activity history.EASY TO USEJust tap “Start” and the app does the rest.  No account setup required.  No registration required.  Doesn’t even require a Wi-Fi or cell phone connection, just a GPS signal.  My.Walk.Run operates in the background so you can continue to use your iPhone to make and receive phone calls, send and receive messages and emails, play music, or run other apps.AUTO-PAUSE It has an auto-pause feature that pauses up to 30 minutes (by default, settable to 5-60 minutes in Settings) before the app asks you if your activity has “Ended?”  With Auto Pause, only the time you are actively moving is used to calculate your average speed, just as if you had used a pause/resume button, but much simpler!ACCURATE & RELIABLE  It is designed specifically for walking, jogging, hiking and running, so it knows when it receives out-of-range GPS data for these activities and disregards the bad data.  It also adjusts distance and calories for uphill climbs.  BATTERY SAVING  Ever forget to inform your app that you ended your activity and have your battery run down because the GPS system remained on?  My.Walk.Run automatically detects when you have ended your activity and shuts off the GPS to save your battery.  BACK-ON-TIMEHave you ever got caught out after it’s too dark to see or got back late (like after the park closed).  This is because you didn’t know when to head-back.  With My.Walk.Run all you need to do is set the “Return Time” or select “Back by Dark” and it does the rest.  It alerts you when it is time to head-back, displays how fast you need to go, and how fast you are currently going.  It also displays an Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) based on your current location and speed.  With My.Walk.Run, you can set the “Return Time” when you start your activity or anytime during your activity and you can even choose a different route back and My.Walk.Run can still get you back-on-time!   PERSONAL SAFETY FEATURESMy.Walk.Run can provide you with detailed directions back to your starting location by providing Apple Maps with your starting and your current location.If you want others to know where you are, you can send your current location via instant messaging or you can email a map of your route showing where you have been and where you are currently.FEATURE SUMMARY• Very easy to use• Very accurate• No account setup required• No registration required• Displays time, distance and calories• Displays average and current speed• Adjusts for uphill climbs • Provides elevation change• Provides a route map• Has auto-pause feature• Saves battery with auto-end• Can get you Back-on-Time• Can get you Back-by-Dark• Can provide directions back • History file for unlimited activities• Maps and details of all activity• Automatic backup of history file• Share location via messaging• Share location via email with route map• Share activity history via email• Post past activity to Facebook• Metric/US units for worldwide supportBATTERY DISCLAIMERContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.

"1047";NA;"Health & Fitness";4;"MyEyeGym is an app developed by the Singapore National Eye Centre (SNEC). It is an orthoptic eye exercise app for people who have an intermittent squint with difficulty maintaining good eye alignment.  Squint (or strabismus, the medical term), is a condition where the eyes are not looking together in the same direction simultaneously, with or without the presence of double vision. There are many types of strabismus and MyEyeGym is suitable for only certain kinds, usually horizontal, non-paretic, and intermittent. Please check with your eye care professional to see if you are suitable for these eye exercises. Research has shown that performing fusion exercise with stereogram images is effective in improving the binocular status of people with certain types of strabismus.  Besides aligning the eyes, these exercises help restore and maintain Stereopsis or 3D (three-dimensional) vision – where two images, one from each eye, are fused (joined) together and seen as a single image in three dimensions.  Stereopsis or 3D vision is important as the appreciation of depth is useful in situations such as threading a needle, running down the stairs, parking a car, playing ball games like basketball or tennis, etc.This version is ios 8 compatible.In MyEyeGym, you will find:1. 18 amazing and interesting stereograms with cartoons and animation2. Eye exercise images that are suitable for both adults and children3. Various levels of difficulty to enhance improvement4. Tools for tracking and recording compliance, as well as the levels achieved5. Alerts to remind you when it is time to do the exercise6. Bonus interactive gamesWhat’s great is that the app is Fun, Engaging, Stimulating and Interactive with a variety of cartoons and animation. Through this app, SNEC hopes to encourage those who need these exercises, to participate actively in the improvement of their visual function.

EYE TESTSThere are several criteria of your vision quality and you can test most of them by passing these tests:– Visual Acuity test helps you check whether the acuity of your vision is within the conventional rate.– Astigmatism test identifies irregular curvature of the cornea or lens. These usually decrease your vision quality if their acceptable intensity is exceeded.– Contrast Vision test measures your ability to distinguish details that are not highlighted or outlined clearly.– Color Blindness test consists of a number of colored circles, called Ishihara plates. It is designed to give a quick assessment of your color vision.– Macular Degeneration test, also known as the Amsler Grid test reveals eye deviances caused by age-related macular degeneration or other macular conditions.EYE EXERCISESAs a rule, we mostly make our eyes work within a certain pattern that’s imposed by our work or habits. Therefore, it is important to train our eyes, so they remember how to do all the other stuff. Here’s how you train them:– Directional exercises help you reduce unhealthy eye strain and improve vision on different distances.– Palming is a simple and effective relaxation exercise that helps you remove eye strain and even clear your mind a little.Go ahead and try them all out!";"MacPaw Labs LTD";3,99;"1.0.2";1527206400

"1200";NA;"Health & Fitness";12;"Background – As part of the study planning, the study team conducted a series of focus group interviews (group interviews) with diverse stakeholders in the target community (i.e., community leaders and advocates, women living with HIV, clinicians, linkage workers, and outreach coordinators). One of the strong recommendations from the focus group participants was that the study intervention include an “intergenerational” education component in addressing cervical cancer prevention among women living with HIV. The focus group findings were shared and discussed at the study investigators meeting in December and then again, at the community advisory committee meeting on December 17, 2015. Based on relevant discussions and brainstorming of ideas, the team decided that we develop a mobile app for study participants (moms) to use when talking to their kids (boys and girls) about cervical cancer prevention—HPV (human papillomavirus). It is because of the role of HPV in causing most cervical cancers.Purpose of HPV mobile app – To assist study participants (moms) in talking to their child(ren) ages 11-26 about HPV (as a method for primary prevention of HPV related cancer including cervical cancer)";"Mongoose Projects Inc";0;"1.0";1462924800

"1285";NA;"Health & Fitness";4;"Rebios provides the best support for tracking sensor data from activity devices, including Watch, Microsoft Band 2 and Bluetooth LE Heart Rate Sensors.Rebios App is not like any other run tracker that's available on the Apple Store.First, the app is developed by people that loves to run. And the app is easy to use for beginners, and customizable for more advanced users.Second, Rebios is open. You literally have data in your hand!  You can export all your data to spreadsheet format, whenever you like, with the tip of your finger. That way you can analyze your data in Numbers or Microsoft Excel, and get further insight into your training.As a supplement, your export contains a GPX-file with a map of your route for each of your runs. GPX (the GPS eXchange Format) is a data format for exchanging GPS data between Apps, and for sharing GPS data with other usersThis means you can do all the analyzing with no further charges! Your data belongs to yourself and does not end up on some web service you pay for.This is the mantra behind Rebios: You own your data. You decide what to do with your data.While you run, the app will collect data about your run. Just tap on the large running man on your phone to start running. Before you start you may configure what kind of data your want to gather. When you are finished running you may do a detailed analysis of you run, as well as compare runs against each other. And if you want to do more advanced analysis, you can just export your data to spreadsheet.Rebios uses SiriKit, just say “Start a Run with Rebios” or “Stop Run” to Siri, to start or stop your run.In addition, you can use your Apple Watch to start and stop your run. During your run, you will be able to monitor all the data you track. Just raise your wrist. While running, you can change the currently displayed sensor just by rotating the crown on the side of your watch. When using Apple Watch, Rebios will use HealthKit to track heart rate sensor data from Apple Watch in real time.if your own an Apple Watch Series 2 or above, you don't even need to bring your phone. Just start your run from Apple Watch, and when you are finished running, all your data will be synchronized to your phone automatically.The app can connect to Bluetooth 4 LE devices. Currently heart rate monitors are supported.If you use Microsoft Band 2 you can start and stop your run from your Band. During your run, you can use Band to monitor all your data - and keep your phone in your armband or belt.In addition, you can observe and compare your runs with the following Band 2 sensors:- Heart Rate- Skin Resistance - Skin Temperature- RR IntervalTrack your weight, and by keeping a record of your weight, you will get the added benefit of being able to monitor the number of calories you burn during your activity.Use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.";"Torben Johansson";2,99;"4.2";1538006400

"1303";NA;"Health & Fitness";4;"REPS is an app that 1. assesses moods, anxiety symptoms, and behaviors with daily questions 2. administers attention bias modification (ABM) training (a type of cognitive training that has been shown to reduce anxiety symptoms). Users can only access the app if they are enrolled in either the REPS (IRB Study Number 12-10411) or Remote REPS (IRB Study Number 17-22529) studies being conducted by Dr. Aoife O’Donovan at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). The REPS app can be used by study participants for a total of 15 days with one training session per day, but participants have 21 days to complete the 15 training sessions. Upon entering the REPS app for the first time, the user rates a list of words in terms of how threatening the words are. This rating is used by an algorithm to create a list of personalized words that are used in the ABM training. Next, the user is asked questions about mood, daily exercise, stress, and alcohol use. After answering questions, the participants complete ABM training. The purpose of ABM is to train participants to look away from threatening stimuli, and has been shown in psychological research to reduce anxiety symptoms. Specific Features:1. Login ID and PINTo engage with any feature of the REPS app, the user must login using an assigned Login ID and PIN ensuring that data are only collected on participants enrolled in the studies. Eligibility for the studies is determined by the UCSF researchers, and only eligible participants will receive a Login ID and PIN that will allow access into the REPS app.2. Security QuestionsParticipants can set security questions that will allow them to login in case they forget their PIN. 3. Word RatingsParticipants view a list of 55 words and they rate how threatening each word is to them. This information is used within a recommender algorithm (similar to netflix recommender) to select personalized words from a large pool of words for use in the ABM training.  4. Daily alarmParticipants can set a daily alarm to remind them to use the app. The daily alarm is automatically disabled once the participant has completed all 15 training days, or once the allotted time for the participant has run out (i.e. 21 days from start of first interaction with REPS app). 5. Data collectionThe app’s data collection includes all responses to the daily questions as well as all data from the ABM training (i.e. words shown, probe location, response latency, correct answer, etc). No personally identifiable information is recorded (e.g. name, birthday, etc) through the app. Only the UCSF study staff have access to any data collected by the app.  6. Notification of training completion to study staffOnce a participant has completed all 15 days of training, an email is sent to the study staff that includes the Login ID for the user who has completed all training days. The REPS app does not have access to user email addresses. The purpose of this feature is to assist the study staff in participant progress tracking. 7. Help - FAQ There is a Help section in the app that has a list of frequently asked questions to guide the participants. It also includes contact information for the study staff and instructions as to how they can end their participation in the study.";"Roshit Omanakuttan";0;"1.0.1";1515110400

At this time I'm with you.

The creator has been described as emptiness, as boundlessness, as light, and as darkness. Whatever is the basis of creation, that’s Brahma. And Brahma is Akhila, which means he’s all-pervading.Ananda refers to the blissfulness or ecstasy of the creator. Swarupa is ‘an image’. So, we are talking about an image of the ecstasy of the creator. Isha means that which rules. Jagadisha means the same thing, said in a different way. Jaga means existence. Jagadisha is the ruler of the existence. The creator is referred to in so many ways, so we’re saying this whole existence is an image of the ecstasy of the creator.

With ScoliCheck you now have access to this tool wherever you are, and for a fraction of the cost of the standard handheld device.With the patient bending forward and the phone placed over the spine, resting on the assessor's thumbs, ScoliCheck displays a reading of trunk asymmetry in degrees.

The person with scoliosis stands in front of the person holding the mobile device with the Scoliometer app. 2. The person with scoliosis slowly reaches their hands towards the floor, bending forward through the back.3. The person with Scoliometer app pulled up on their mobile device puts their thumbs under either side of the phone while looking at the app. They rest their thumbs on either side of the spine and slide the phone down the person’s back in front of them while they roll down.• Accurate: doctors can use it along with home users• Informative: users can save their previous results on their own to show changes over time by saving a screen shot of the Scoliometer at the highest degree of curvatureTips:Not sure if you have scoliosis?

This dialogue can take place in many different languages, increasing access for victims.After providing information on their options, victims are asked if they would like to request advocacy services or initiate the process of reporting to law enforcement. They can provide as much or as little information as they choose; they can even remain anonymous, if they wish.This is when the program shifts from “Seek” to “Speak.” If victims choose, they are connected directly with law enforcement and/or a victim advocacy organization for support. All of this happens in the reassuring environment of Seek Then Speak. Options are also available for reporting within the U.S. military or on college campuses.If a victim chooses to seek assistance, the agency-facing technology Victim Link triggers a notification to alert law enforcement and/or victim advocacy via phone call, text message, or email. Agencies can configure how these notifications are sent, which staff members receive them, and what information they include.To learn more about Seek Then Speak, visit http://www.seekthenspeak.com.Law enforcement or victim advocacy agencies interested in learning more about Ten8Tech’s Seek Then Speak and the agency-focused portal Victim Link (groundbreaking technology that’s revolutionizing sexual assault reporting) should visit http://www.victimlink.com or call (844) TEN8TECH (836-8832).";"Ten Eight Technology, Inc.";0;"1.3.3";1524009600

Each of the Solfeggio titles has it's own frequency and each note in this scale has specific spiritual healing properties. These recordings uses the various notes.The Six Main Solfeggio Sonic Sound Healing Meditation Titles are:UT - 396 Hz - Liberating Guilt and Fear RE - 417 Hz - Resolving Past Trauma and Facilitating Change MI - 528 Hz - Transformation and Miracles (DNA Repair) FA - 639 Hz - Harmonising Relationships SO - 741 Hz - Communication & ExpressionLA - 852 Hz - Awakening Intuition The Solfeggio Sleep and Relax meditation recording works on connecting and harmonising relationships and deals with our perceptions of love. It can help you to change the way in which you interact with the world so that you bring more harmony and balance in your life and can help with issues around self-love and acceptance, loneliness and emotional stability.When you are instructed to repeat affirmations, connect with positive feelings (e.g. happiness, joy, love), this will help you absorb the suggestions on a deeper level. You don't have to repeat the affirmations out loud but do make a strong connection with them.About the Ancient Solfeggio Scale and Healing Sounds:Modern science is now beginning to recognise what the ancient mystics throughout time have been saying; that everything is in a constant state of vibration, and therefore everything that is vibrating has a sound (even if it’s not audible). Everything also has its own optimum rate of vibration, and this is called resonance. When we are in resonance, we are in balance and harmony with creation.Emotions and mental states also have their own optimum resonance and with the recognition that every organ, and every cell, absorbs and emits sound, we can therefore understand how specific sounds and frequencies can be used as powerful healing tools. This is how the ancient Solfeggio frequencies work and is why the Gregorian monks used this specific scale for chanting and healing.These incredible tones each resonate to specific frequency that our original blueprint is composed from. Exposing ourselves to these frequencies helps to bring our bodies, cells and DNA back into balance. Different parts of our bodies and organs all have specific frequencies of optimum resonance (perfect state of health), and therefore listening to these tones allows the body to absorb and remember its original blueprint, moving it back towards its prefect state of alignment and resonance (health).Do NOT listen while driving or operating machinery.If you suffer with serious depression or epilepsy please consult your doctor before listening.Jason Stephenson acknowledge the pioneering work of Dr. Joseph Puleo and Dr. Leonard Horowitz in decrypting the ancient Solfeggio Tones and advancing Healing Codes for the Biological Apocalypse and 528records. Dr Horowitz contacted our office to say he had heard great things about our recordings and now sells them through his own website.c1e62136f0";"Phil Burgess";0;NA;NA

Feelings are automatic, both positive and unpleasant ones. We can become much more aware of our feelings and use them to our benefit thus, experiencing the most joy possible. As humans we are emotional beings. Learning to understand our emotions and what event triggers a particular emotional response helps us gain control over our actions and teaches us to make positive choices through reason rather than being powerless over our emotions and our responses.Using these tools will result in being better able to control our anger, shame and handle the times we feel humiliated.

"1486";2,2;"Health & Fitness";4;"Whether you need a proper warm up, a cool down, or a relaxing, healing recovery, Stretching and Warm Up Routines will guide you through the right types of stretches for the right occasions and it will show you how to do them effectively. Most people learned back in elementary school that they should do static stretching (where you hold a stretch for a few minutes) before running or engaging in sports to prevent injury. It turns out that static stretching before a workout not only decreases athletic performance, it can actually increase the risk of injury. The right way to get ready for an intense workout is dynamic stretching: This active form of stretching moves your muscles through the full range of motion to increase your blood flow, reduce tightness, deliver important nutrients to muscles, and improve your athletic performance. Stretching and Warm Up Routines will show you the most effective type of warm up for running and nearly every type of sport. Add it before any activity and you will be amazed by how much your performance improves.No matter how well you warm up, athletic activity still puts stress on the body. Stretching and Warm Up Routines also includes foam roller programs to give yourself a deep tissue massage and release knots that limit movement, keep your muscles tight, and lead to injury. Foam roller stretching is also excellent for for body builders, or anyone that wants to build healthy muscles, to prep their muscles for growth.If you don't have a foam roller, Stretching and Warm Up Routines still includes great ways to cool down your muscles and lessen post-workout soreness by flushing out the lactic acid. This is where static stretching is best. Done at the proper time, in the proper way, static stretching will help you improve your balance, blood circulation, flexibility, range of motion, and production of synovial fluid (the fluid that reduces friction in your joints).FEATURES• The right stretches for the right reasons. A mixture of static, dynamic, and foam roller stretches maximizes your results. • Fast and efficient. Holding positions for longer than 30 seconds is less effective.• Works anywhere!

This typically resolves within 16-18 hours and we have all experienced this, especially after a loud concert or a long day at work- typically a feeling of muffled sound and perhaps some ringing in your ears.  The app measures the softest sound that can be heard before the music or noise exposure, and then again after the music or noise exposure.  This difference is a measure of the temporary hearing loss, also known as temporary threshold shift (or TTS). A small shift, measured in decibels or dB, is not significant, but larger ones between 6-15 dB (orange), or even greater than 15 dB (red) can be indicators of over-exposure.  If this happens, then a day or two of relative quiet may be very useful, in order to prevent this temporary problem from becoming a permanent one.

"1725";NA;"Medical";4;"Your Child’s Development Milestones (YCDM) is a software programme designed to record and analyse a wide variety of markers or milestones which are considered to be significant in the development of children from the age of three months to six years.These markers are generally considered to be important indicators of the rate at which a chid acquires a variety of different physical, mental and emotional skills.The development milestones used in this software were selected on the basis of their common usage and their diagnostic significance. The use of these milestones was cross-referenced against a number of highly reputable sources.Milestones are divided into categories, with 93 in Movement, 100 in Cognitive, 80 in Social and Emotional, 76 in Language and 39 in Hearing and Vision. Milestones are provided at three month intervals up to the age of 2 and at 12 month intervals up to the age of 6.Recording the presence or absence of these milestones allows the software to calculate an overall development age for the child, and a development age in each of the above categories. This allows a more specific identification of strengths or weaknesses.Important milestones such as crawling, walking or talking are flagged if the child fails to acquire them at a specified age. These flags alert the parent or guardian to a potential problem and indicate a recommended course of action.Your Child’s Development Milestones is an important parenting aid, especially for couples with their first child. It helps to reassure parents when their child is developing normally, alerts them to potential problems and identifies exceptional children at an early age.The early detection of development problems is very important as in many cases it can result in prompt remedial action which allows the child to develop normally. Failure to identify potential development problems early in life may hinder the child’s acquisition of important skills and impair their ability to realise their full potentialThe inclusion of 388 development milestones covering five development categories and the recording of data at three month intervals for the first two years, makes this software the most detailed and comprehensive childhood development programme currently available.The inclusion of flagged alerts ensures that parents will not miss development delays in any important milestone.Provision for image and voice attachment enables parents to include an oral and visual record of their child’s development.";"WWW Machealth Pty Ltd";0;"3.0";1527206400

It is offered annually on the last Wednesday in February to all ACGME-accredited and RCPSC-accredited Emergency Medicine residency programs for a small fee. Programs are not required to participate in this examination.The examination targets the expected knowledge base and experience of an EM3 resident. Unlike other ABEM examinations, the ITE does not have a passing score. It is a standardized examination that residents and program faculty can use to judge an individual resident’s progress toward successful ABEM certification. There is a strong relationship between the ITE and Qualifying Examination scores. Physicians with higher ITE scores have a higher likelihood of passing the Qualifying Examination and those with lower scores have a lower likelihood of passing the Qualifying Examination.The examination is not designed for program evaluation, and the results should not be used to compare programs or residents across programs.";"Internet Testing Systems, LLC";0;"1.4";1537920000

"1753";NA;"Medical";17;"Acetabular version refers to the anteroposterior orientation of the acetabular opening relative to the true horizontal axis of the pelvis. The normal human acetabulum is anteverted in order to allow impingement free range of motion including flexion, adduction, and internal rotation. Abnormal acetabular version has been correlated with pathologic hip conditions including femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) and developmental hip dysplasia.The association between acetabular version and hip pain has been well established in recent years as a source of contributing to early hip osteoarthrosis and labral tears. Recognition and appropriate treatment of abnormal acetabular version is crucial to preventing irreversible damage to the hipAcetabular version is conventionally evaluated on CT scans but excessive radiation doses associated with routine use of computed tomography (CT). An objective radiographic tool which provides measurements comparable in accuracy to CT measurements has been developed by Dr. Hefti (Nomogram).Tedious and time-consuming  calculation has to be done in simple X-rays in order to calculate the acetabular anteversion. The primary goal of this App is  to help  determine radiographic values of acetabular anteversion in a practice in a blink of an eye and avoiding CT scans.The  App is medical software aimed for orthopaedic surgeons, providing tools that allow doctors to:-Securely import medical images directly from the camera or stored photos.-By marking  certain points in  a simple standard AP pelvic radiograph, geometric parameters are being calculated. The App  computes the acetabular  anteversion  based on a pelvic AP radiograph. The angle of anteversion is calculated through the formula according to Heftis nomogram. The  acetabular orientation (anteversion/retroversion) is determine by the app by the measurement of the angles between the center of the femoral head and the anterior (f) and posterior (f’) acetabular rim.Once you choose correctly the anterior and posterior acetabular rims the app calculates the acetabular anteversion based on nomogram. -The data are printed over to screen so each case can easily assessed -Save the planned images, for later review or consultation.The software is a class II medical device in the FDA. All information received from the software output must be clinically reviewed regarding its plausibility before patient treatment! TheApp indicated for assisting healthcare professionals. Clinical judgment and experience are required to properly use the software.The software is not for primary image interpretation. In a busy everyday practice, the examiner have to draw lines in X-rays or in clinical settings, this it is time consuming and cumbersome. Accessory instruments like protractors, hinged goniometers, well sharped pencils, calculators, rulers or even transparent papers must be available. The build in feature of the app, allows to  calculate easily the version angle easily and help decide what could be considered normal or pathologic. This App is particular useful in clinical settings where you need a quick results without losing time.

"1762";2,9;"Education";4;"Draw it to Know it – Medical ScienceDraw it to Know it: Medical Science is an online educational platform that teaches students neuroanatomy, gross anatomy, cell biology, biochemistry, general biology, fundamental neuroscience, anatomy, physiology, and biology and many more courses through a specialized, research-validated approach.	Science education is out of step with students’ needs.  Numerous products exist that make science education more accessible, but they fail to improve upon the way science, itself, is taught (especially in the fields of anatomy and biology).  Draw it to Know it, instead, improves the educational process.	Since it was first introduced, as the Oxford University textbook (Neuroanatomy: Draw it to Know it), our active learning approach has been praised for making science education simpler and more effective.  Our tutorials begin with a blank page (now screen!) and proceed in hand-drawn steps that students master through active engagement, which, as research substantiates, greatly enhances the learning experience.	When our materials are used together with a standard neuroanatomy, gross anatomy, or human biology course, the results are dramatic: “By completing the Draw it to Know it tutorials prior to class, student performance is at its highest level in 10 years.”  Gammon M. Earhart, PhD of Washington University in St. Louis, School of Medicine.

"1850";NA;"Medical";12;"The DIRE Score is a tool that can be used to aid clinicians in their decision-making process when considering prescribing opioids for chronic non-malignant pain. Using the DIRE Score, the clinician rates seven factors each on a scale of 1, 2 or 3 with 1 being the least favorable or highest risk for prescribing opioids and 3 being the most compelling or lowest risk for prescribing. The seven DIRE factors are: Diagnosis, Intractability, Risk (there are four risk factors—psychological and chemical health, patient reliability and social support/life roles) and Efficacy. Adding the scores for these seven factors gives a total of 7 – 21. A score of 7-13 was predictive of a low probability of success when prescribing opioids; whereas a score of 14-21 was more likely to be associated with a successful prescribing process and outcome. The DIRE Score does not take into account medical risk factors for opioid prescribing such as comorbid medical conditions (chronic obstructive lung disease, sleep apnea, concomitant use of benzodiazepines, etc.). The clinician should understand that active use of illicit drugs, drug diversion and other aberrant behaviors is incompatible with ongoing opioid prescribing no matter what the DIRE Score may be. The DIRE Score is not meant to be a substitute for sound clinical judgment in the context of any individual patient. This App is meant for informational use only, and is not intended to aid in the diagnosis, treatment or prevention of disease.

"1864";2,3;"Medical";4;"The ASE Echo AUC App provides a simple, practical approach for physicians to pursue additional professionalism in their daily practice in a more accessible and attainable way. The physician will be motivated to use this app because he/she will be able to have an immediately accessible source to make a quick decision for patient care that is backed up by expert opinion.  The physicians will find it easy to use the free AUC App to stratify the patient, by disease and condition, into different treatment scenarios and determine quickly whether an echo should be ordered.  They will also be prompted with information on how to best describe these testing limitations to the patient. They will then have more time to focus on the care of the patient and be able to eliminate extra, unneeded or overused testing. This App includes the 98 AUC indications for transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE).This App also includes information on the Choosing Wisely campaign and the lists of ""Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question"" that the other participating societies have developed. By including all of the societies' lists this App will educate all physicians utilizing this device about these recommendations, enhance the communication skills of physicians and promote conversations between physicians and patients about utilizing the most appropriate tests and treatments and avoiding care that may provide limited benefit. This App would also foster attitudinal change among physicians and patients.The American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF), in partnership with the American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) and along with key specialty and subspecialty societies, conducted a review of common clinical scenarios where echocardiography is frequently considered. The original document was published in Journal of American Society of Echocardiography (JASE) in 2011 that combined and updated the original transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography appropriateness criteria published in 2007 and the original stress echocardiography appropriateness criteria published in 2008. The indications in this document were developed by a diverse writing group and scored by a separate independent technical panel on a scale of 1 to 9, to designate appropriate use (median 7 to 9), uncertain use (median 4 to 6), and inappropriate use (median 1 to 3).Support for this app was provided by the ABIM Foundation, as part of a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to advance the Choosing Wisely campaign.";"American Society of Echocardiography";0;"2.0.0";1401753600

"1918";NA;"Medical";17;"Human hip is a biologic system that obeys purely mechanical laws. The main concern of the orthopedic surgeon especially those treating the dysplatic hip is to improve the biomechanical status of the joint. To accomplish this, the surgeon must be familiar with the biomechanics of the hip. Because of the complexity of biomechanical analysis (trigonometric functions, etc.) is almost impossible to calculate  in everyday settings, forces acting on the hip, the directions in which they act, and the associated stresses that develop within the joint. With measurements by the App and having numerical data it is possible to evaluate the efficacy  or even predict it of the various procedures not on the basis of experience any more. The Hip Biomechanics App is medical software aimed for orthopaedic surgeons, providing tools that allow doctors to:-Securely import medical images directly from the camera or stored photos.-By marking certain points in a simple standard AP pelvic radiograph, geometric parameters are being calculated. The App computes weight-bearing contact surface, the load (R) and stress (P) on the measured hip. Data from load and pressure distribution in the hip - like in a real biomechanicals tests- are being measured and depicted graphically as vectors over the X-ray  in the screen over the joint. The distribution also of compressive stresses over the acetabulum, which is usually associated radiographic sclerosis over the acetabular margin, are printed in real time over the screen and thus can be easily and  objectively evaluated. Besides that, the App provides data in export for diagrams of load (R) pressure (P), which  each can be plotted as a curve allowing easy comparison with normal data and thus help decide the orthopaedic surgeon which procedure is objectively indicated.-The data are printed over to screen so each case can easily assessed -Save the planned images, for later review or consultation. Data are exported as txt file, ready to print or to input as cells to numbers or excel ready for chart printing and further research.The software is a class II medical device in the FDA. All information received from the software output must be clinically reviewed regarding its plausibility before patient treatment! Hip Biomechanics App indicated for assisting healthcare professionals. Clinical judgment and experience are required to properly use the software.The software is not for primary image interpretation.	The app coverts a standard pelvic X-ray from a simple image into an accurate biomechanical analysis study, involving a calculation of the joint load and pressure. In clinical settings easily assessments of hip load and pressure may help planning operations, modify or monitor objectively treatment strategies in a effort to improve hip biomechanics. The sound  build-in computational methods of the app allows in a blink of an eye in front of your screen to do complex biomechanical studies.  This App is particular useful in clinical settings where you need a quick results without losing time, in a busy everyday practice.

Selecting it a second time marks the pill with an X indicating that the pill was missed for that day. Selecting today’s pill a third time will return the pill back to the original “not taken” setting in case you had not taken it. To help avoid any mistakes you will only be able to change your pill status for your current day and past days. The pills for the next day onwards will be disabled.Virtual blister strips begin with the word “Start” and contain arrows to guide you to the next day.A reminder is displayed to count down till your next pill. If you’ve missed taking the pill at the set time then the timer changes to indicate the time the pill is overdue by.Below that is an approximate count of how many days remain till the start of your menstrual cycle. This is not shown if you have selected Azalia®. Some women may not start bleeding on the first day but within the 7 day break from the pill. If you experience bleeding outside of the 7 days while taking the pill then you may want to consult your GP. For Azalia® when a strip is empty, you must start with a new pack the next day – without interruption and without waiting for bleeding.When you go on holiday to a destination in a different time zone it is important to continue to take your pills at 24 hour intervals. This app will keep that 24 hour timing as long as your phone remains set to Irish time, which may be different to the local time at your holiday destination. For example, if the app is set to remind you daily at 10am Irish Summer Time (i.e. 09:00 GMT) and you travel to Melbourne then you will be reminded to take your next pill at 19:00 local Melbourne time. If you change your app reminder settings to the local time at your destination, then you will need to calculate the difference in hours to make sure your pills are taken at the correct time. It is your responsibility to make sure your pills are being taken correctly.You will also be notified with a pop-up message if you’ve not visited the app for more than one day.

Paid version offer 24 hrs.How it works?• Relaxes and reduces stress• Increases focus while enhancing privacy• Helps you sleep by blocking distractions• Soothes headaches and migraines• Masks tinnitus (ringing of the ears)• Pacifies crying babiesExplanation?Sound masking can be explained by analogy with light. Imagine a dark room where someone is turning a flash light on and off. The light is very obvious and distracting. Now imagine that the room lights are turned on. The flash light is still being turned on and off, but is no longer noticeable because it has been ""masked"". Sound masking is a similar process of covering a distracting sound with a more soothing or less intrusive sound.The masking must reduce the difference between the steady background level and the transient levels associated with both speech and other sounds. Motivation and productivity are improved when this is accomplished. The masking sound itself must not change rapidly and should be as meaningless as possible.Sound masking reduces or eliminates awareness of pre-existing sounds in a given area and can make a work environment more comfortable, while creating speech privacy so workers can better concentrate and be more productive. Sound masking can also be used in the outdoors to restore a more natural ambient environment.White noise is a common synthetic noise source used for sound masking by a tinnitus masker.This is add-supported version of NOISE. Some functions are available in full version. Please upgrade.";"andrzej kar";0;"1.1.7";1497484800

It offers two evidence-based treatment approaches in 1 app:  semantic feature analysis & errorless learning. It also includes a custom naming test. Describe: Semantic Feature Analysis (SFA) is an evidence-based treatment approach for naming that focuses on the meaning-based properties of nouns. The client is asked to describe each feature of a target word by answering a set of questions. Choose the ‘Describe’ mode in the app to use this therapy approach. SFA is most suited to clients who have mild to moderate aphasia and intact cognitive skills. Listen & Repeat: The premise of the Errorless Learning treatment approach is that users will not struggle to name an item. Instead they are helped to learn the words by listening to them in turn, and repeating them.Choose the ‘Listen & Repeat’ mode in the app to use this therapy approach. The app repeats the name of the item three times and asks the user to repeat it three times. This is the default setting. You may adjust the number of times the app repeats the name of the target item as well as the number of prompts it gives the user to repeat.Errorless Learning is most suited to clients who are able to accurately repeat, able to self-monitor, and who have good recall skills. Custom Test: Noun Trainer Home also allows you to test the person’s ability to name the target items and determine which items need to be practiced. It is therefore perfect for taking baseline scores and repeat testing following a period of practice.Features- Clear and uncluttered user interface- Over 100 high-quality real-life photos of household objects- Adjustable settings allowing you to choose the items you wish to test and/or practice in therapy - The option to set the number of times the target word is repeated and the number of prompts to repeat which are given in the ‘Listen & Repeat’ mode- Tracking of scores in 'Test' - The option to email a results summary- The automated iOS voice of Siri";"APTUS SPEECH & LANGUAGE THERAPY LTD";5,99;"1.6";1495584000

These features make the NUCOG ideal for use in a wide range of clinical settings, including office-based health practice, hospitals, and clinic use. The NUCOG combines a thorough coverage of major cognitive domains (attention, memory, language, executive and visuospatial function) with relative brevity and ease of use. Each cognitive domain is scored out of 20 possible points, yielding a maximum NUCOG score of 100. Validated in a variety of psychiatric, neurologic and general medical populations, the NUCOG provides a multidimensional profile of an individual's cognitive status, and takes less than 20 minutes to provide an in-depth assessment of cognitive functioning. An individual's cognitive profile is plotted against normative data means and standard deviations for each domain, allowing the ready visualisation of the pattern of cognitive weaknesses and strengths. The NUCOG is available in English, Spanish, Portuguese, Malay, Uyghur and simplified Chinese versions. When integrated with a clinical assessment, this can greatly assist in the diagnosis and management of cognitive disorders and serve as a guide to more in-depth formal neuropsychological testing.The iPad version of the NUCOG allows for drawing directly on the screen, or the utilisation of the iPad's built-in camera, to record patient responses. It also uses the in-built clock of the iPad for timed tests. Results of testing can be printed or emailed in PDF file format. Why use the NUCOG? The NUCOG provides multidimensional scoring, covers areas of cognitive function that other tools neglect (such as executive functioning, spatial memory), is portable and straightforward to use with minimal training.
