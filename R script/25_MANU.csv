When your pet exhales, tap the Breath button to start the timer. Continue to tap the Breath button each time your pet exhales. Once complete, the number of breaths will display.CALCULATIONS If you select 15 Seconds, the app will calculate each time you tap times 4.

If you select 60 Seconds, the app will display the number of times you tap.FEATURES The Apple Watch will provide haptic feedback with each tap.

No audible feedback so you wont disturb your precious pet at rest! Please set the Apple Watch to silent to fully utilize this feature.OUR STORYI created this app when our rescue dog, Bizou, went into heart failure at age 13 and was diagnosed with a grade 5 heart murmur. She is on several medications and our vet recommended we begin tracking her breathing to help them in regulating the dosages of her medications. My wife and I found it difficult for just 1 person to watch her breathing while also watching a timer to know when to stop counting. My goal was to make this much easier.DISCLAIMERContact your veterinarian for normal and elevated heart rates for both cats and dogs. If your pet has an elevated heart rate or you have any concerns about his or her health, please immediately contact your vet.FEEDBACKPlease send your feedback to support@verkadesg.com.
