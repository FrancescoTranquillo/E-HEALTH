655242441;"OnScreen Retrovirus";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/onscreen-retrovirus/id655242441?mt=8";"Updated for the future: 64-bit native code. ""A Best Science App (highest rating: Excellent)--Great interface, easy navigation"" Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology News Dec 2013** NO ADS **Do you (or your students, if you're a teacher) know why the AiDS-causing virus, HIV, is called a retrovirus and how it actually uses the material and machinery of the ""host"" cell it has invaded to reproduce itself? Do you (or they) have a firm idea what the terms ""minus strand, PBS, PPT, and LTR"" mean? What does tRNA have to do with retroviruses, anyway? The simulations of OnScreen Retrovirus use the 3D nucleic acid models of our highly regarded DNA apps to make memorable the crucial steps by which the reverse transcriptase enzyme complex of a retrovirus uses nucleotide building blocks of the host cell to copy the viral genome, initially on a single strand of RNA, to a newly constructed double-stranded DNA molecule, ready to be inserted into the host's DNA as a source of new copies of the virus.The goal of this app is to convey the conceptual details of the viral genome transfer from RNA to DNA without requiring of the user a deep prior knowledge of molecular biology. Since a ball-and-stick model of nucleic acids is used for the simulations, this is not done at the level of atomic detail, but the simulations are never in conflict with the biochemistry.Unlike other simulations you might see on the internet, this app shows how the DNA synthesis is at every stage a three-dimensional double-helix-forming process and that it involves several steps, which include the separation of strands and the relative movement of the strands to allow annealing to each other at complementary sections, the steps being dependent on three separate activities of the reverse transcriptase complex: RNA-dependent DNA synthesis, RNA degradation, and DNA-dependent DNA synthesis. The role of the virus's nucleocapsid protein as enhancer of the annealing of strands is also indicated.Since retrotransposons--which we all have in our DNA!--make use the very same steps to make new copies of their DNA through an intermediate RNA strand before inserting it at another spot in the cell's DNA, the app serves as a simulation of how they work as well. Background material on viruses, nucleic acids, and enzymes, as well as commentary on each new step in the process of copying the single strand of RNA into a double-stranded DNA molecule are at your fingertips in the app. You can run the simulations with automatic pauses at key steps for convenience in reading of the commentary for the steps or straight through, pausing only when desired.Whether for first-time learning, clarification of ideas previously encountered, or review, OnScreen Retrovirus is now at your service.";1;"across specialties";"";"";NA;NA;"L'obiettivo di questa app è quello di trasmettere i dettagli concettuali del trasferimento del genoma virale da RNA a DNA senza richiedere all'utente una profonda conoscenza preliminare della biologia molecolare.";"";NA;"Test";"GinecologyAndObstetrics";NA;NA

Video Demo of the App (Highly recommend that you view this before using the app) http://youtu.be/otA4Eox94uMNext version update will support iOS 8 onlyGolfXion uses the front facing camera of iPhone and iPad to notify you when your head has moved. GolfXion detects that you are about to start your golf swing when your head remains sufficiently still, which automatically starts the head movement detection mode. After this GolfXion will play an audio alert when your head moves. GolfXion will make a video recording of the entire session between the auto-start and the head movement, and this video will be automatically played. GolfXion will then automatically go back to detecting the start of your golf swing. GolfXion will continue to repeat this entire cycle until you exit the detection mode. GolfXion gives you instant feedback on head movement in order to improve the effectiveness of your time at the driving range.In order for GolfXion to detect head movements, your iPhone and iPad must be mounted on a stand as a constant frame of reference is required. Please visit http://www.golfXion.com/ for suggested stands. There must be sufficient space between the golfer and the stand holding your Apple device.

Please check the technical specification for your Apple device and look for Face Detection in video mode before purchase.BackgroundDid you know that all good golf swings have one thing in common? You need to keep your head still. It's no secret that you have to keep your head still in order to maintain good golf posture. It is so important that it applies to swings with your drivers, fairway woods, irons and putting. Good posture will improve your putting too. Most golf swing flaws are caused by moving your head while taking your golf swing. Golf coaches constantly correct this flaw.Keeping your head still is an important fundamental that you need to have someone constantly check for your while you practice. Usually that would be your golf coach. Unfortunately, muscle memory takes around 1,000 hours of practice to ingrain which is why golf professionals are always playing golf and working on their golf swing. So for 1,000 hours of golf coaching time that adds up to be quite a big sum of money.GolfXion uses Apple's Face Detection video hardware acceleration to detect your head movement. It is really simple to use as there are no buttons to press before taking a swing, GolfXion uses the front facing camera to automatically detects when you head is still and gives you an audio alert when your head moves. GolfXion automatically replays the video of your recent golf swing.NOTICE: Tripods or stands to hold your iPhone and iPad are NOT included.

We make it happen!  Contact us:  company@cloudninedevelopment.comWe Build Doctor App or Your Practice App in DaysCloud Nine Development, LLCSmartphones and Web ApplicationsShould I have an App?Are Apps the next Web?  Undoubtedly the answer is Yes. You could and should be the first in your specialty in your area to have an App for your patients and referring physicians.Your Doctor App could be your personalized iPhone application that could be downloaded by your patients from iTunes.com for Free.  They will be able to find you on the iTunes App store by the name you choose (e.g. your name or practice name).  Doctor App has various features from office hours, GPS enabled directions to office locations, contact information to patient education material.  Doctor App could inform your patients about current events and services offered at your practice.  Patients could contact your office for medical records, medication refills, or ask a technician a question right from your application on their phone.  Patients or your referring physicians could request an appointment with you right from the phone through the Doctor App.  By uploading relevant patient education material, a specialist could have their referring doctors use your application for patient education material and then refer patients to you. Here are some of the reasons why a Doctor App would be beneficial compared to a website:User Interface customized to mobile phones and superior to web layout.Ability of user/patients/public to have improved, increased access to their physicians.Increased ability of the physician to reach out to their patients using a current news type function that will update each users application in real time.Potential to reduce costs and save time.  Users can contact/make requests of clinic/hospital staff without a phone call or in person contact.Easy accessibility to physicians offices through GPS enabled map functions on the smartphoneAbility of users to be able to have immediate access to a phone directory and synced callingPatients do not need to remember doctors or nurses names to navigate web and websitePersonalized patient education material that can we emailed or hosted on the application, with similarly personalized patient education videos. The videos can be present on the app and referring physicians can have the patient look at it before they come to see the specialist.We believe Doctor App has the potential to improve practice marketing and branding, patient education and communication, and personal and practice efficiency. Cloud Nine Development, LLC (www.cloudninedevelopment.com) is a company managed by physicians and they have developed the Doctor App.  Our first product is the Eye Handbook (www.eyehandbook.com), an iPhone application available on Apples iTunes store (www.iTunes.com).

They are medical students and teachers, primary healthcare providers, physicians, practitioners, and nurses. Join them today to get your ECG knowledge refresh.Medical App Editor's Review:Here is a beautiful app with rich collection of real 12-lead ECG cases you can use to develop your interpretation skills. Each case is identified with a brief description (e.g., ""Male 73 y/o, HR 158; Ectopic arrhythmia - atrial tachycardia with intraventricular aberrant conduction...""). Select a case and you can choose either Play mode, which shows you the ECG telemetry as you'd see it on a monitor in real time, with beeps for heartbeats, or Read mode, which gives you the printed ECG tracing to interpret. You can choose cases by category or search for them by name. You can also bookmark cases and return to them later.For students and practitioners who wish to strengthen their ECG-reading capabilities, this app would seem justified, because ECG Cases gives you an effective way to immerse yourself in a wide range of ECG patterns and interact with them as if these were your own patients.Customer Reviews:1.

This app helps children learn social rules and behaviors through stories. The Social Norms app is ideal for parents, educators, and speech language pathologists as it allows full customization. The users have the ability to add their own photos, text, and audio recordings to create individualized stories that teach specific skills that the child with autism spectrum disorder may have difficulty learning or understanding. The Social Norms app includes over 50 stories with clear graphics in the following categories:11 Manners Stories:  Saying Thank You, Excuse Me, I Am Sorry,  Saying Hi , Using the Inside Voice, Sharing with Friends, Asking for Help, Waiting for My Turn to Talk, Personal Space , Picking the Nose, Passing Gas15 Hygiene and Health Stories: Washing Hands, Brushing Teeth, Washing Hair, Brushing Hair, Taking a Bath, Showering,  Getting Dressed, Trimming the Nails,  Using Hand Lotion, Putting Sunscreen, Using the Toilet, Headache, Stomachache, Runny Nose, Eating HealthyThree Safety Stories: Crossing the Street, Bike Safety, Seat Belts Six Home Stories: Going to Bed, Cleaning Up Toys, Doing Homework, Helping Mom and Dad, Staying in the Chair During MealtimeEight School Stories: Asking Someone to Play with Me, Waiting in the Hall, Answering in the Classroom, Being Bullied, Being Teased, Recess, Fire Drill, Following Directions in the ClassroomFive Community Stories: Going to the Dentist, Going to the Doctor, Going to the Hairdresser, Going to the Restaurant, Going ShoppingFive Behavior Stories: Biting Others, Pushing Others, Pulling Others Hair, Hitting the Head on the Wall, Running AwayAlthough research is still needed in the area of teaching social skills to children with autism spectrum disorders through stories, a number of studies have concluded that using stories to teach particular social behaviors or skills are in fact successful and children may benefit from this type of intervention. Furthermore, evidence indicates that incorporating visual aids (e.g., visual activity schedules) has positive findings, suggesting that visual aids can be effective for teaching social skills and interactions (Reichow & Volkmar, 2010, p 161).The National Standards Project (National Autism Center, 2010) also supports teaching social skills through stories as an established treatment for children with autism spectrum disorder for children ages six to 14, with evidence-based findings.
