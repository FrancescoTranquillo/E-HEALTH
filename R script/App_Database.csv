It is like a happiness and vitality pill with no negative side effects.But how does it work? BodyBrainDance, a movement system that has been created and developed for 30 years, uniquely engages both small and big parts of your body, while playing with different speeds of movement and intensity levels. That leads to feeling more active and alive.BodyBrainDance has been taught under the name “Stopping Movement” to more than 500 groups of participants, and it has been used by them to:Release mental and physical stressWhile BodyBrainDancing, your mind gets in a state where it is primarily aware of the sensation of your body moving. The combination of movement and focused awareness leads to relaxation and stress release.Protect muscles and jointsBodyBrainDance activates muscles and joints you do not normally use. Since injuries and chronic pains often come from repetitive movements, you are now protecting yourself while exercising AND having fun.While practicing BodyBrainDance for a few minutes per day, you can experience these benefits:Physically, you will be able to move with agility, balance and suppleness, become stronger, with healthier muscle tone and stamina, and experience increased circulation, fewer aches and discomforts.Mentally, you will be able to focus, problem-solve and remember better, reduce the “internal noise” and control your internal dialog, and experience everyday life mindfully.Emotionally, you will be able to transform a bad mood into joyful emotions, experience less stress and feel more centered while feeling calmer, joyful and caring.In 2018, we decided to make the system available to ANYONE, ANYWHERE, ANYTIME!With the support of the original developers of the system and many of the system’s instructors worldwide, we developed the BodyBrainDance mobile app, which teaches you the basic principles of the system.You create a customized BodyBrainDance session in seconds, using especially composed and produced dance music that was created specifically for the app – so you can get the most out of your session.All you need to do is choose:The duration of the session (15/30/45/60 minutes)The maximum speed/intensity of the music (slow/medium/fast)One of the four build-ups of the sessions (steady/slow-to-fast/random/wave) andClick on “create session”.The BodyBrainDance app does the rest…Are you ready to join the movement?";"Body Brain Dance, Open Circles Academy S.L., Health & Fitness, Entertainment, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";NA;4;"English";"1148549799";"Open Circles Academy S.L.";"Health & Fitness";0,99;"$";"50.9 MB";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA
