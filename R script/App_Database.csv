In this highly interactive course Professor Barkhof and colleagues discuss the need for novel approaches to disease activity assessment in patients with relapse-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) undergoing therapy with disease-modifying drugs, and review the evidence base supporting the efficacy of current/emerging therapies in achieving NEDA. Based on their own practical experience, the expert faculty review the latest publications in the field and discuss how novel measures of disease activity, such as NEDA-3 and NEDA-4, can be used in clinical studies to determine those therapies that may have the greatest potential to ameliorate disease progression and enhance patient outcomes.This course has been awarded 1 European CME credit (ECMEC) by the European Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (EACCME). Developed by faculty to support physicians in understanding the concept of treating to a target of NEDA in multiple sclerosis and its potential clinical applications, this 1-hour course utilizes a blend of interactive formats and videos to facilitate and reinforce learning.

It does not count steps.  It is a GPS-based app that calculates your distance and speed using your change in location.  It is designed for outdoor use.It provides advantages over most other GPS fitness apps: 1. Easier to use with an auto-pause feature, 2. An auto GPS shut-off battery saver, 3. Can get you “Back on Time” or “Back by Dark”, and 4. Easy to share your route map and activity history.EASY TO USEJust tap “Start” and the app does the rest.  No account setup required.  No registration required.  Doesn’t even require a Wi-Fi or cell phone connection, just a GPS signal.  My.Walk.Run operates in the background so you can continue to use your iPhone to make and receive phone calls, send and receive messages and emails, play music, or run other apps.AUTO-PAUSE It has an auto-pause feature that pauses up to 30 minutes (by default, settable to 5-60 minutes in Settings) before the app asks you if your activity has “Ended?”  With Auto Pause, only the time you are actively moving is used to calculate your average speed, just as if you had used a pause/resume button, but much simpler!ACCURATE & RELIABLE  It is designed specifically for walking, jogging, hiking and running, so it knows when it receives out-of-range GPS data for these activities and disregards the bad data.  It also adjusts distance and calories for uphill climbs.  BATTERY SAVING  Ever forget to inform your app that you ended your activity and have your battery run down because the GPS system remained on?  My.Walk.Run automatically detects when you have ended your activity and shuts off the GPS to save your battery.  BACK-ON-TIMEHave you ever got caught out after it’s too dark to see or got back late (like after the park closed).  This is because you didn’t know when to head-back.  With My.Walk.Run all you need to do is set the “Return Time” or select “Back by Dark” and it does the rest.  It alerts you when it is time to head-back, displays how fast you need to go, and how fast you are currently going.  It also displays an Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) based on your current location and speed.  With My.Walk.Run, you can set the “Return Time” when you start your activity or anytime during your activity and you can even choose a different route back and My.Walk.Run can still get you back-on-time!   PERSONAL SAFETY FEATURESMy.Walk.Run can provide you with detailed directions back to your starting location by providing Apple Maps with your starting and your current location.If you want others to know where you are, you can send your current location via instant messaging or you can email a map of your route showing where you have been and where you are currently.FEATURE SUMMARY• Very easy to use• Very accurate• No account setup required• No registration required• Displays time, distance and calories• Displays average and current speed• Adjusts for uphill climbs • Provides elevation change• Provides a route map• Has auto-pause feature• Saves battery with auto-end• Can get you Back-on-Time• Can get you Back-by-Dark• Can provide directions back • History file for unlimited activities• Maps and details of all activity• Automatic backup of history file• Share location via messaging• Share location via email with route map• Share activity history via email• Post past activity to Facebook• Metric/US units for worldwide supportBATTERY DISCLAIMERContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.

It is an orthoptic eye exercise app for people who have an intermittent squint with difficulty maintaining good eye alignment.  Squint (or strabismus, the medical term), is a condition where the eyes are not looking together in the same direction simultaneously, with or without the presence of double vision. There are many types of strabismus and MyEyeGym is suitable for only certain kinds, usually horizontal, non-paretic, and intermittent. Please check with your eye care professional to see if you are suitable for these eye exercises. Research has shown that performing fusion exercise with stereogram images is effective in improving the binocular status of people with certain types of strabismus.  Besides aligning the eyes, these exercises help restore and maintain Stereopsis or 3D (three-dimensional) vision – where two images, one from each eye, are fused (joined) together and seen as a single image in three dimensions.  Stereopsis or 3D vision is important as the appreciation of depth is useful in situations such as threading a needle, running down the stairs, parking a car, playing ball games like basketball or tennis, etc.This version is ios 8 compatible.In MyEyeGym, you will find:1. 18 amazing and interesting stereograms with cartoons and animation2. Eye exercise images that are suitable for both adults and children3. Various levels of difficulty to enhance improvement4. Tools for tracking and recording compliance, as well as the levels achieved5. Alerts to remind you when it is time to do the exercise6. Bonus interactive gamesWhat’s great is that the app is Fun, Engaging, Stimulating and Interactive with a variety of cartoons and animation. Through this app, SNEC hopes to encourage those who need these exercises, to participate actively in the improvement of their visual function.

Health problems and parenting issues can arise anytime – evenings, weekends, when you’re at work or traveling or your doctor’s office is closed.MyHealth Pal is designed especially for these concerns and challenges. Why parents and caregivers prefer MyHealth Pal:Reliability:MyHealth Pal is derived from the clinical protocols used by pediatricians and nurses in 10,000 practices and 400 nurse advice call centers in the US and Canada.

If not, there are quick links to related care guides.· Decision Chart which helps determine what action is suggested based on the severity and description of your symptom.  Once you have a match, simply follow the corresponding action, such as Call 911, Call Your Child’s Doctor Now, Call Your Child’s Doctor within 24 Hours or Manage at Home. · Immediate Connections to medical help, such as 911, your child’s doctor or nearby Emergency Department (ER) are available if you have phone service.· Home Care Advice is available for any illnesses and injuries that can be treated at home.

The Occly Safety App pairs with the Blinc™ to allow seamless transfer of images from the device to the cloud.

The notifications are marked on your map so that you can be aware and take precautions as needed.•	CROWDWISE™ allows users to anonymously mark areas of suspicious activity on their map. Because all users can see these marked points, they are now informed of areas in their community to be cautious about. Also, included on the map are crimes committed across the USA, further empowering our users with valuable information. •	Dynamic Crime Index provides a crime index value for the user’s current location. As the user moves from one location to the next, our crime index adjusts based on the location. •	HOMEWATCH™ feature allows the user to use the Blinc™ as a home/hotel security system by enabling the cameras to use motion and sound detection to guard your entryway.  •	Rewards program lets users collect rewards for every time they contribute to the CROWDWISE™ map.•	Refer-a-Friend allows you to share your personal coupon code with your friends so they can get discounts off the Blinc™ device while you earn cash from their purchase.";"Occly, Occly LLC, Lifestyle, Health & Fitness, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"1.7.29";12;"English";"1185059650";"Occly LLC";0;"0";85,5;2018-09-27;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;2018-10-09
