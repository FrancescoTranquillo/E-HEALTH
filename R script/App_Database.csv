His image is found throughout India, Sri Lanka and Nepal. Hindu sects worship him regardless of affiliations. Devotion to Ganesha is widely diffused and extends to Jains and Buddhists.Although he is known by many attributes, Ganesha's elephant head makes him easy to identify. Ganesha is widely revered as the remover of obstacles, the patron of arts and sciences and the deva of intellect and wisdom. As the god of beginnings, he is honoured at the start of rituals and ceremonies. Ganesha is also invoked as patron of letters and learning during writing sessions. Several texts relate mythological anecdotes associated with his birth and exploits and explain his distinct iconography.Ganesha emerged as a distinct deity in the 4th and 5th centuries CE, during the Gupta Period, although he inherited traits from Vedic and pre-Vedic precursors. He was formally included among the five primary deities of Smartism (a Hindu denomination) in the 9th century. A sect of devotees called the Ganapatya arose, who identified Ganesha as the supreme deity. The principal scriptures dedicated to Ganesha are the Ganesha Purana, the Mudgala Purana, and the Ganapati Atharvashirsa.Key Features:=  Very good and simple User Interface=  Very Soothing Flowers coming on the screen randomly=  Very good quality of sound=  Image change in 5 seconds so that you get to see more images every minute=  Temple Bells and Shankh to give you a Temple-like experience.=  Gives you a very peaceful experience.=  Used by Top celebrities from Bollywood and Glitterati.";"108 Names of Ganesh, Dipen Ambalia, Health & Fitness, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"4";4;"English";"1052515329";"Dipen Ambalia";0;"0";28,2;2016-06-19;2016-01-26;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;2018-10-10

Moreover, work from home!! This is a great way to get a good muscle burn without doing a really high intensity cardio workout. With the Active-Static style of training you have a group of two different exercises that use a similar position and utilize the same muscle groups. For example, the first group of exercises in the workout video are a traditional push up and a plank. Both of these exercises utilize almost identical muscle groups, actually the only muscle group that is not used by both exercises is the triceps which is more predominately used in the push up and is either not used or only lightly used depending on the style of plank you choose to do.The term static means lack of movement. And as this term implies, with static training you take a weight and hold it in a fixed position for several seconds. This concept is based on the idea that by forcing the muscle to work only when it is maximally contracted and using the heaviest weight possible, you can optimize its growth potential. You have to admit that it makes sense. The question is, does it work?The answer is yes; it does work when used properly. This is due mainly to the overload that's involved, as well as to the unique stimulus with which it jolts the muscle.When you train using a full ROM, the amount of weight you can use is limited by your sticking point—the point in the exercise ROM where you're weakest. You can only use as much weight as you can lift through that sticking point. With static contractions, you eliminate the sticking point, so you can overload the muscle fibers with as much weight as you can hold for at least 10 seconds in a particular muscle's strongest position.Static contraction training may seem like a new concept, but it's hardly a radical, untested training philosophy.";"15 Minute Total Body Active Workout Challenge Free, Cristina Gheorghisan, Health & Fitness, Lifestyle, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"1.3";4;"English, French, German, Italian, Romanian, Simplified Chinese, Spanish, Turkish";"1082155443";"Cristina Gheorghisan";0;"0";48,7;2017-01-29;2016-08-22;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;2018-10-10

To prove it, we’ve put together some quick, energizing exercises that you can do at home in minutes. These simple moves work your whole body yet don’t require hours of effort—plus, your baby will be front and center during these moves, so the two of you can bond while you’re working out. You can do the “quickie” routines separately or together every other day. With your doctor’s approval, it’s fine to start doing these exercises as early as six weeks after you’ve given birth (probably longer if you had a Cesarean section).TIPS:* Baby safety: When performing exercises in which your baby must hold his head up on his own, be sure he can do so without discomfort (usually starting at 3 to 4 months old).* Mom prep: Before performing any exercise, roll your shoulders back and down and draw your navel toward your spine to protect your back. Inhale through your nose and expand your ribs. Exhale through your mouth, drawing your abdominal muscles in.Exercises - 20 seconds each - 3 series with 1 minute rest between series:- Lunges- Squats- Bridges- Lifts- Sitting twists- Push-ups- Planks6 REASONS to start training:1. Build yourself a smashing fit body - because there is no greater feeling than looking in the mirror and simply just love what you see.2. Brag around about your toned muscles - low body fat level, noticeable muscle definition and shape, but not significant muscle size3. Keep your heart strong and healthy - because your heart is a muscle also and it gets stronger and healthier if you live an active life. 4. A clear and beautiful glowing skin - you don't have to worry anymore about cellulite when you're half naked on the beach. No more dimply skin coming out of your swimsuit.5. Reduce stress, anxiety and fight depression - regular training is the key for your head just as it is for your heart and will relax you, making you calmer, fighting depression and dissipate stress.6. A happier soul and a bigger smile - you will feel that you are finally doing something for yourself.BONUS: Improve your live life! you know exercise is good for you, but do you know how goof?

The user must locate the red dot after it appears, then disappears.  The user must “activate” the blue dot by touching it before the invisible red dot can be found.  Once the blue dot is activated it will turn green and then the user may attempt to find where the dot was located.There are four variations in this game.1)	One after the other – find dots one after the other2)	Digit span – find dots but also remember a sequence of numbers and letter, which user must enter at the end of the game.3)	All at once – user must find multiple dots which appear all at once, all on the same game.4)	Sequential – user must find multiple dots which appear in a sequence, all on the same game. There are many parameters that can be set to ensure the user can be challenged at the appropriate level.  To make things easier, the user may choose to use the grid or the “reveal” options. To make things easier the user may choose to add an activation delay, forcing the short term memory to hold on to the memory of the dot location for longer.";"Accurate Eyes, Paul Michael, Health & Fitness, Medical, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";NA;4;"English";"1200293028";"Paul Michael";1,99;"$";65,7;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;2018-10-10

According to a clinical research published in American Journal of Hypertension (https://academic.oup.com/ajh/article/30/7/683/3739803/An-Assessment-of-the-Accuracy-of-Home-Blood), 36% home blood pressure monitor users can not get accurate reading with their own device, because of the intrinsic design problem. The invention of Accutension is to improve blood pressure measurement accuracy.Accutension improves accuracy by employing doctors' blood pressure measurement method. Doctors use a stethoscope to listen to the sounds of blood flow pulse to find out blood pressure values during BP cuff deflation. Accutension uses the same method but even better because,1. Accutension records the sounds (Korotkoff sounds) of the blood flow pulse during measurement;2. Accutension visualizes the sounds, so you will see the sounds on your phone screen when you hear the sounds;3. You can playback the sounds after measurement to re-confirm the blood pressure readings;4. You can email the measurement raw data including the sounds to a medical professional to double confirm the reading if you are not sure.Accutension is different from those automatic blood pressure monitors that do not sense the sounds. The automatic blood pressure monitors normally use oscillometric algorithms to estimate blood pressure values. Different manufacturers use different algorithms and could give very different readings.Accutension is different from those smart blood pressure monitors, which mainly use smartphone to store the readings. Accutension uses the smartphone as a part of the instrument to find the readings other than just store the readings. Except this big difference, Accutension has the same features as other smart blood pressure monitors. For example:1. Accutension stores both the result and the raw data, so all the measurement result can be traced back;2. Accutension can show the visual trend of blood pressure on daily, weekly, monthly and yearly basis.Start to get accurate blood pressure readings now.";"Accutension Blood Pressure Kit, Shanghai Hulu Devices Co Ltd, Medical, Health & Fitness, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"1.0.7";12;"English, Simplified Chinese";"1053971681";"Shanghai Hulu Devices Co Ltd";0;"0";36,8;2018-06-14;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;2018-10-10

Avalon began as a global research project studying how to make a positive difference in human communication. It was coordinated across six continents representing all cultures, investigating commonalities in human behavior.As we know, social media in its current form has not had a lasting positive effect on the majority of people. But why is that? We all use it, we desire to share.We believe the reach of social media is important and here to stay, but probably not in its current form, function or implementations. Our goal was to make a fundamental change in social media for the betterment of all. Avalon was born.We all desire the same things: honesty, understanding, and to be accepted. Avalon is the only service designed to make it easy for you to communicate in that way. But like anything else, it needs you. If you want to make a change or just get a long-needed break from all the constant social noise on every communication channel, please come join us and bring your friends. Together we can build the connected world we all want.Although Avalon looks very simple, it is a highly sophisticated system that models real human communication and awareness. It is based in the most current findings in neuroscience, computer architecture, and human-machine interface design. It has been used at top medical facilities and in a host of other applications.Unlike other technology companies, we understand that your primary objective is to authentically connect with with people on the other side of your communications. The uniqueness of Avalon is that you can do everything you normally enjoy on any other social network, minus the unwanted interruptions and soapbox tangents. Avalon has the one ingredient all other social media lacks, the ability to build deeper relationships while extending your thoughts and emotions through the internet.After years of being in development and in use in closed applications, we decided it was the right time to offer Avalon to the general public. We feel we have created the best environment where you can reach those who are important to you and also develop a better understanding of yourself.People that use Avalon say that it’s a calming oasis. And it’s true. This is not marketing hype or a hook for a sinister business model that profits off your information. These are real users and what they experience.Of course, we want everyone on Avalon to have fun, explore, and reach as many people as they can. The difference is, now you’ll know what people are thinking and when they thought it. And for the first time, you may also understand how they feel about themselves. Avalon will be evolving to do things that before were only the promises of science fiction. It’s going to be an amazing journey for you and us, so get aboard and let’s travel to that new destination together.Lastly, we are a small company with a big vision. Our work is highly respected around the world but we need your involvement to influence history unfolding for the better.

Meditation is a mental skill that can be used to release the activities of the day, rather than replay them on an endless loop as you're trying to fall asleep. Even on the nights when you are experiencing insomnia, you can still use meditation to silence your mind and relax the body.  END STRESSPerhaps the most powerful anti-stress tool one can develop and hone is meditation. Through meditation, we can learn effective ways to reduce stress and cultivate deep inner peace. This program will help you practice methods such as breath awareness, mindfulness and visualization to silence stress. PRACTICE MINDFULNESSMindfulness calms your mind to a point where you are able to relax fully and get the sleep that you need. It is much easier to tackle the problems in your life with a clear and healthy mind.  MINDFUL DIETINGThroughout this process, you will be grooming your subconscious mind to accept and incorporate the suggestions it receives during meditation.

Eat fewer calories than you use during the day and you'll lose weight. Add in exercise and you may also be able to improve your body composition, since the exercise will help you maintain your muscle so you lose mostly fat.Lower Blood PressureWeight loss may help you lower your blood pressure levels, according to a study published in ""Diabetes Care"" in July 2011. Although improvements were greater in people who lost more weight, even those losing just 2 to 5 percent of their weight were more likely experience improvements in systolic blood pressure.Improved MoodNot only will you look better, but you may also feel better if you lose weight. Studies performed using participants of the National Weight Control Registry have found that weight loss may also lead to improvements in mood.Higher Energy LevelsThe National Weight Control Registry studies also noted that people who have lost weight tend to have more energy.

It is like a happiness and vitality pill with no negative side effects.But how does it work? BodyBrainDance, a movement system that has been created and developed for 30 years, uniquely engages both small and big parts of your body, while playing with different speeds of movement and intensity levels. That leads to feeling more active and alive.BodyBrainDance has been taught under the name “Stopping Movement” to more than 500 groups of participants, and it has been used by them to:Release mental and physical stressWhile BodyBrainDancing, your mind gets in a state where it is primarily aware of the sensation of your body moving. The combination of movement and focused awareness leads to relaxation and stress release.Protect muscles and jointsBodyBrainDance activates muscles and joints you do not normally use. Since injuries and chronic pains often come from repetitive movements, you are now protecting yourself while exercising AND having fun.While practicing BodyBrainDance for a few minutes per day, you can experience these benefits:Physically, you will be able to move with agility, balance and suppleness, become stronger, with healthier muscle tone and stamina, and experience increased circulation, fewer aches and discomforts.Mentally, you will be able to focus, problem-solve and remember better, reduce the “internal noise” and control your internal dialog, and experience everyday life mindfully.Emotionally, you will be able to transform a bad mood into joyful emotions, experience less stress and feel more centered while feeling calmer, joyful and caring.In 2018, we decided to make the system available to ANYONE, ANYWHERE, ANYTIME!With the support of the original developers of the system and many of the system’s instructors worldwide, we developed the BodyBrainDance mobile app, which teaches you the basic principles of the system.You create a customized BodyBrainDance session in seconds, using especially composed and produced dance music that was created specifically for the app – so you can get the most out of your session.All you need to do is choose:The duration of the session (15/30/45/60 minutes)The maximum speed/intensity of the music (slow/medium/fast)One of the four build-ups of the sessions (steady/slow-to-fast/random/wave) andClick on “create session”.The BodyBrainDance app does the rest…Are you ready to join the movement?";"Body Brain Dance, Open Circles Academy S.L., Health & Fitness, Entertainment, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";NA;4;"English";"1148549799";"Open Circles Academy S.L.";0,99;"$";50,9;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;2018-10-10

This tool is based on a statistical model known as the ""Gail model,"" which is named after Dr. Mitchell Gail, Senior Investigator in the Biostatistics Branch of NCI's Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics.The Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool is an interactive tool designed by scientists at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) to estimate a woman's risk of developing invasive breast cancer. The tool has been updated for African American women based on the Contraceptive and Reproductive Experiences (CARE) Study. See About the Tool for more information.Before using the tool, please note the following:    * The Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool was designed for use by health professionals. If you are not a health professional, you are encouraged to discuss the results and your personal risk of breast cancer with your doctor.    * The tool should not be used to calculate breast cancer risk for women who have already had a diagnosis of breast cancer, lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS), or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).    * The BCRA risk calculator may be updated periodically as new data or research becomes available.    * Although the tool has been used with success in clinics for women with strong family histories of breast cancer, more specific methods of estimating risk are appropriate for women known to have breast cancer-producing mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes.    * Other factors may also affect risk and are not accounted for by the tool. These factors include previous radiation therapy to the chest for the treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma or recent migration from a region with low breast cancer rates, such as rural China. The tool's risk calculations assume that a woman is screened for breast cancer as in the general U.S. population. A woman who does not have mammograms will have somewhat lower chances of a diagnosis of breast cancer.";"Breast Cancer Risk Assessment, YEH TSUNG MING, Medical, Health & Fitness, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"1.6";17;"English";"324655388";"YEH TSUNG MING";2,99;"$";2,2;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;2018-10-10

Feel better right away with the easy, enjoyable Meditation Oasis® Breathe & Relax app. It will help you develop the habit of breathing in a natural, relaxed way throughout the day.  Experience stress relief, relaxation and more energy with three simple tools:1 - BREATHING EXERCISE -- This simple voice-guided exercise will help you learn to breath in a natural, easy way. Instead of a complicated exercise in which you have to count, pause, or breathe in a particular way, this exercise uses an intuitive approach. It guides you to tune into your body and discover your own, natural way of breathing. The exercise is pleasurable to do and you'll look forward to doing it rather than feeling it's a chore. 2 - FOUR BREATHING BREAK AUDIOS -- These audios are designed for brief breathing breaks during the day. There are four to choose from, each with a different focus -- Basic Breath Awareness,  Deep Breathing, Pleasure Breathing, and Belly Breathing. 3 - BREATHING REMINDERS -- Do you ever notice that you hold your breath when you're concentrating on something or feeling stressed? It's very common! Our muscles tense when stressed and our breathing becomes constricted or even stops. All it takes is a simple reminder to get you to relax and breathe more deeply. You can choose when you wish to be reminded, and choose from voice prompts, sounds or use the silent mode and receive visual reminders only. *****************************Created by Mary Maddux, MS, HTP and Richard Maddux, best known for their popular Meditation Oasis podcast and CDs.

Introducing the concept behind the CALCIVIS imaging system, this short animation shows how the CALCIVIS imaging system applies CALCIVIS photoprotein which, in the presence of free calcium ions, produces a very short, low level light flash. An integrated intraoral sensor within the CALCIVIS imaging device immediately detects the luminescence (light flash) and presents clinicians with a chair side demineralization image for discussion with patients.Calcium ions, in fluid filled enamel pores, act as markers of active demineralisation, regardless of cause (‘early’, none, or micro-cavitated caries or erosive).  Visualising these free calcium ions is the CALCIVIS key to unlocking minimal intervention approaches and motivating patient engagement meaning that when identified early, non-cavitated active enamel demineralisation can be “healed” with oral health advice and simple topical treatments.CALCIVIS photoprotein is a first for dentistry: a dental biologic which produces light exclusively as a reaction to the presence of free calcium ions released from actively demineralising tooth surfaces such as those associated with caries or erosion. When CALCIVIS photoprotein contacts free calcium ions, such as those found on actively demineralising tooth surfaces, a very short, low-level flash of light (luminescence) is created which is undetectable by the naked eye. Luminescence is different to fluorescence: the reflection of a light by a substance that has had another light energy shone on it.Unique to CALCIVIS imaging system the resulting luminescence occurs only in the presence of free calcium (bound calcium in sound enamel does not generate the light signal) meaning that CALCIVIS delivers a predictable result with low or no false positives. CALCIVIS imaging device is a specialised device designed exclusively to image the tooth surface after delivering a metered application of CALCIVIS photoprotein. Initiated via a “one touch” computer controlled process, a specialized sensor integrated into the device immediately detects the resulting luminescence (light flash). In less than 1 second, bespoke software presents a chair side demineralization “hot-spot” image map to clinicians, enabling informed and efficient dialogue with patients.CALCIVIS imaging system supports the preventive dentistry approach by enabling minimal intervention decision-making, improved patient motivation and compliance in caries management and associated enamel demineralization conditions.";"CALCIVIS imaging system, Immersive VR Ltd, Medical, Health & Fitness, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";NA;12;"English";"1120198674";"Immersive VR Ltd";0;"0";128;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;2018-10-10

Chakras are energy centers located through your physical body; the most important ones are 7, and they influence your life flow.In order to live a balanced life, you must maintain your Chakras in constant balance. When one of them is closed, the others will compensate by opening up more and this will create unbalance in your body, as well as unbalance in your spirit.How to Balance your Chakras?Each Chakra is associated with different colors and different sounds. Certain stones can tune your Chakras and allow energy to flow through them.The same can be done with certain wave frequencies. Chakra Meditation was devised and studied to help you tune your Chakras through meditation. Just tap once the buttons and a soft tune related to that Chakra will start. Tap again to stop it.We put a lot of passion in creating this app, and decided to make it FREE so that everyone can enjoy it and use it to improve their spiritual life.For a better experience and to truly enjoy the high quality of the music, we recommend using headphones instead of speakers.*Chakra Meditation Includes*- 7 HIGH QUALITY tunes, specifically created for each of the 7 most important Chakras- A detailed information page on each of the Chakras, useful to remind what energy centers of the body they influence, their location and their name.- The screen will change color once you select a specific Chakra, aiding you in your meditation.- High definition background, created for iPad Retina display but available on all Apple devices.- For a brief overview of how to use the App, just tap the Question button on the lower right side of the screen for help.Here are some reviews for Chakra Meditation Balancing:••••• This app has literally and figuratively assisted in changing my perspective on life!

We all have a hero lurking inside us, incognito. This app is dedicated to all those who want to overcome their anxiety and are seekers of peace, resilience and courage. It is created for those who wish to learn more about that lionhearted individual residing deep within them that wants to come forth to do what is good. It is a guide to a service mindset so that victimization, self-pity, hatred, and doubt can be exposed for what they are—imposters trying to sabotage the real hero within all of us.  In this app, “Couragekeepers: Uncovering the Hero Within,” Debra Norwood, an attorney-peacebuilder, certified laughter leader—expert level, and certified brain health coach has gathered information from various disciplines such as positive psychology, neuroscience, therapeutic humor and laughter, and mindfulness and meditation, in order to create a self-help tool to foster resilience.  She directs the user to her favorite expert resources, authors, and personal experiences to provide not only a quick reference guide to principles about courage and wellbeing, but also to empower the user with self-sufficiency, accountability, and a service mindset, all explored through personal journaling.Why journaling? Studies have shown that documenting positive experiences can help the brain combat negative thoughts and their physical reactions to them. Prompts in the app also encourage engagement in many other brain healthy habits including joining a community of other Couragekeepers to share experiences and to meet others who have overcome adversity and found meaning as helpers and healers in this world.Through this app, users will experience personal growth by exploring their character strengths, optimism, understanding, ability to reinvigorate themselves, act in altruism, and show grit and empathy in order to uncover the hero within them.  By journaling some of these basic building blocks for inner peace, users reinforce their own self-worth and tap into a wealth of information about what the world needs most today—COURAGE!For a list of resources and to meet other Couragekeepers, follow us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram @Couragekeepers.

1064952369;"CURO Clinic ";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/curo-clinic/id1064952369?mt=8";"OVERVIEW:  The CURO Human app is designed for Clinicians and Physical Trainers and works together with a MyoDynamik CURO system to record muscle contractions during periods of physical activity.BACKGROUND: Acoustic Myography (AMG) (also known as phonomyography, sound myography, vibromyography, and surface mechanomyogram) is a technique that measures the low frequency sounds (1 Hz to 200 Hz) created during muscular activity – sounds that can often be heard with ones ear pressed up against a contracting muscle.CLINICIANS:  can use this tool to help them locate and assess a muscle related injury. Our CURO system and purpose built sensors are capable of accurately recording the contractions made by active muscles – no need to shave or prepare your subject.PHYSICAL TRAINERS:  can use the CURO to better assess a subject’s strength, endurance, efficiency and coordination as well as better identify muscle injuries and follow their recovery.- Simply select the muscle/muscles of interest using our app- Rub in our acoustic gel to ensure good acoustic contact with the skin- Place our sensor on the gel - Tape the sensor in place with the bandage provided- Connect the sensor to the CURO- Activate the CURO and establish a WiFi link with our app- Start recording in real-timeThe applications for which the CURO has been tested include:- Muscle imbalance assessment – examining gait issues- Muscle disease or wasting assessment- Muscle performance assessment – following a re-training program- Muscle fatigue assessmentThe CURO system not only presents muscle sounds in real-time it also provides a real-time balance score to enable you to detect muscle imbalances with the aid of our unique ESTiTM Score. AMG-measurements are sent to an iPad so you can immediately see how your muscles function.ESTi TM INTERPRETATION:  The CURO system is unique in that it measures the number of active fibers (spatial summation; S) and the frequency with which they contract (temporal summation; T) as well as the way in which the Central Nervous System (CNS) recruits and uses the active fibers in a muscle (synchrony/efficiency; E). It is only by combining the timing aspect of muscle fiber contraction that one can start to assess the synchrony with which the CNS recruits active fibers in a muscle – and in so doing, more accurately determine the significance of both the signal amplitude and frequency.E - Efficiency:  the E-parameter refers to the period of muscle fiber activity during a recorded period of exercise – muscle efficiency. A high score obtained during moderate to high levels of exercise is a sign of a very well trained and highly coordinated / efficient muscle movement.S – Spatial summation:  the S-parameter refers to the number of muscle fibers recruited during a movement, as part of exercise or a muscle contraction. A low score obtained during moderate to high levels of exercise is a sign of a very well trained and highly coordinated muscle movement.T – Temporal summation:  the T-parameter refers to the speed with which muscle fibers are activated repeatedly during a movement, as part of exercise or a muscle contraction. A low score obtained during moderate to high levels of exercise is a sign of a very well trained and highly coordinated muscle movement.In addition to these individual scores, the CURO system calculates the ESTi Balance for muscle groups – allowing the user to quickly assess muscle imbalances in the body that could give rise to lameness or early fatigue and muscle soreness.ESTi Balance:  	   ± 10% from ZERO = MILD IMBALANCE                           ± 20% from ZERO = MODERATE IMBALANCE                           > ± 20% from ZERO = SERIOUS IMBALANCE";"CURO Clinic, MyoDynamik ApS, Medical, Health & Fitness, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"1.1";4;"English";"1064589212";"MyoDynamik ApS";0;"0";21,1;NA;2016-04-25;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;2018-10-10

The application features over 100 muscles with trigger points and referral patterns, and for every muscle there is a detailed description of function, anatomy and innervation in word and graphics. Dry needling is the use of a solid needle for therapy of muscle pain (myofascial pain). Dry needling contrasts with the use of a hollow needle to inject substances. Such use of a solid needle has been found to be as effective as injection of substances in such cases as relief of pain in muscles and connective tissue. Acupuncture and dry needling techniques may be similar, but their rationale and use in treatment are quite different.The application is based on the important work of Dr. Janet Travell.Dr. Janet Travell was an expert on myofascial pain - a term used to describe pain and dysfunction of skeletal muscles - and pioneered numerous techniques for dealing with chronic pain. Dr. Travell co-authored, with David Simons, the acclaimed two-volume book Myofascial Pain and Dysfunction: The Trigger Point Manual. (Volume 1 was published in 1983 and dealt with the upper half of body, volume 2 was published in 1992 and dealt with the lower half.) Dr. Travell served as Associate (and later Emeritus) Clinical Professor of Medicine at The George Washington University, and remained an active figure up until her death at the age of ninety-five, writing, giving lectures, and attending conferences.The application is easy to use and a quick help in finding the most important muscle(s) responsible for your patient's pain; a usefull guide in your daily ""myofascial pain"" practice.

Those sounds can be picked up by the microphone in your phone or earbuds, and can be played from your music library! EarMachine is helpful in situations ranging from talking in noisy restaurants to watching television at home. This work is funded by the National Institutes of Health (of the United States of America). Features:Simple Interface, Complex ProcessingWith a simple interface, EarMachine, allows you to adjust more that 150 signal processing parameters with a simple swipe of your finger on a wheel. The mapping from wheel position to parameter values is the result of a large-scale analysis of the hearing status of more than 10,000 people. EarShare: An intelligent recommendation engineEar Machine also contains a recommendation engine called EarShare. This engine will listen to the sounds around you and use that information to recommend wheel positions. The recommendations are based on both large-scale analyses of hearing abilities as well as your usage of the app. EarShare will give better recommendations the more you use the app.Listen to whatever sounds you want. Ear Machine allows you to choose whether you want to listen to the microphone in your iOS device, or the one in your earbuds (iOS 7 only). You can also use Ear Machine to listen to songs/podcasts in your music library. State of the Art Signal ProcessingThe signal processing in Ear Machine is similar to what is used in most hearing instruments. A wide-dynamic range multiband compressor ensures that quiet sounds are amplified,  while protecting you from sounds that are already loud. A multiband limiter provides further protection from loud sounds. An expander makes sure that very quiet sounds (e.g., refrigerator hum) are not annoying. You can even use Ear Machine as a sound level meter (works best with phone microphone).";"EarMachine, Ear Machine LLC, Health & Fitness, Music, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"1.2.2";4;"English";"409971156";"Ear Machine LLC";0;"0";8,7;2017-01-23;NA;3,7;22;41;0;27;18;14;2018-10-10
