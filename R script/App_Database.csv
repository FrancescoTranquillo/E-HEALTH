Chakras are energy centers located through your physical body; the most important ones are 7, and they influence your life flow.In order to live a balanced life, you must maintain your Chakras in constant balance. When one of them is closed, the others will compensate by opening up more and this will create unbalance in your body, as well as unbalance in your spirit.How to Balance your Chakras?Each Chakra is associated with different colors and different sounds. Certain stones can tune your Chakras and allow energy to flow through them.The same can be done with certain wave frequencies. Chakra Meditation was devised and studied to help you tune your Chakras through meditation. Just tap once the buttons and a soft tune related to that Chakra will start.
