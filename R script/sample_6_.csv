The recommendations are based on the guidelines of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) , most recently updated in November, 2016.  They are intended to reduce the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) and other sleep-related infant deaths such as accidental suffocation in bed. Many sudden unexpected infant deaths are preventable, and these guidelines give caregivers the skills to do so.  This application provides a visual tool to enhance discussions with a parent, a sampler of safe sleep education material that can be downloaded from the SCNJ website, links to important educational websites and to the safe sleep policy statement and technical report of the AAP, and a Q & A providing more details on safe infant sleep.  The safe sleep guidelines are intended for infants from birth to twelve months of age and for both full term and preterm infants. Families are further encouraged to discuss these guidelines with their infant's healthcare provider.The SCNJ is funded in part by a health services grant from the NJ Department of Health.";"SIDS Info, Zyndo LLC, Education, Medical, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"2.1";12;"English";1149116133;"Zyndo, LLC";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/zyndo-llc/id1149116133?mt=8";0;NA;240;"2018-05-17";"2018-03-20";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;"2018-10-25"

In a natural disaster, disease outbreak, terrorist attack, or other major emergency, a network of local, regional, state and federal systems will initiate pre-planned and practiced responses. Above and beyond the actions you can expect from municipal and public health entities, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) recommend that you and your family prepare to take care of yourselves as much as possible in a disaster.For the most basic preparedness, this means:1. Having a basic Disaster Kit and supplies that will sustain you and your family at home, or a remote location for a minimum of three days.2. Collecting your Medical Information and Vital Information in one reliable and easily accessible location to quickly care for yourself in emergency triage scenario. SLO MakerSpace app helps its users prepare for an emergency.SLO MakerSpace app does not require internet connection for use; however, there may be links to web content that may not be accessible without cell service or web connection.";"SLO MakerSpace, One Siren Productions Inc., Medical, Utilities, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"1.2";12;"English";949238781;"One Siren Productions INC";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/one-siren-productions-inc/id949238781?mt=8";0;NA;41,8;"2016-09-01";"2016-07-28";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;"2018-10-25"
