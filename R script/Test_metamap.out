Processing text_000N_34068.tx.7: Unlike other simulations you might see on the internet, this app shows how the DNA synthesis is at every stage a three-dimensional double-helix-forming process and that it involves several steps, which include the separation of strands and the relative movement of the strands to allow annealing to each other at complementary sections, the steps being dependent on three separate activities of the reverse transcriptase complex: RNA-dependent DNA synthesis, RNA degradation, and DNA-dependent DNA synthesis.

Just turn the repellent sound on and keep your mobile phone near you. No mosquito bites any more!Keep the application close to you and enjoy the outdoors without bites..The app does not guarantee a 100% protection as there are over 3500 known mosquito species in the world and they all react slightly different to the repellent.
