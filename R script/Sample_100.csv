The app represents an animated embodiment of the Kanal Method, the procedures developed and utilized by Dr. Kanal in his clinical practice when he performs risk assessments on patients with foreign bodies/implants/devices who are requested to undergo MR imaging examinations.After mastering an in depth understanding of the individual component safety issues underlying the MR imaging process and associated with MR imaging environments (including but not limited to static magnetic field safety issues, gradient magnetic field safety issues, and radiofrequency magnetic field safety issues), this app provides an orderly and standardized approach to the assessment of potential risks associated with MR imaging of a patient in/on whom there may be a foreign body/implant/device.  The potential benefits of scanning that same patient must also be assessed by the MRMD/radiologist caring for that patient and compared against the potential risks of so doing.  In this manner an accurate benefit/risk ratio assessment can be derived.While running this app, the bottom of the screen continually records a ""breadcrumbs"" trail of the pathway chosen by the user of the app in answering the questions posed to them about the foreign body/implant/device being evaluated.  Clicking on any of the ""breadcrumbs"" at any time will bring up a graphic representation of the ""history"" or pathway taken by the user throughout the risk assessment process.  This can then be saved and/or exported via e-mail or SMS message as a .pdf file to demonstrate how the assessed level of risk of scanning that patient/device was derived, based on the answers provided by the user.  In this manner one might be able to document why a requested MR examination on a patient/device might be approved - or denied.To enlarge the text presented in any of the central orange bubbles own this app, simply tap once on the orange bubble.  To return to the initial screen/size, simply tap on the orange bubble once again.The app will function in either portrait or landscape mode on iPad or iPad Pro devices, but is only functional in portrait mode on all model iPhones.The app also contains a full sized, high resolution, printable, ""e-mail-able"" .pdf version of the decision tree diagram underlying the structure and function of the app itself.";"Kanal’s MR Risk Assessment, Emanuel KANAL, Medical, Education, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"1.0.18";17;"English";"1114168861";"Emanuel KANAL";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/emanuel-kanal/id1114168861?mt=8";99,99;"$";24,2;"Oct 15 2018";"Oct 15 2018";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;2018-10-19

It has methods to assess the Motor-Neuron activity of the left and right brain. Designed to be a fun among friends, it does finds applications in some serious situations too. As a Game:1.	You have 4 modes – Right Brain, Left Brain, Left and Right Brain and Whole Brain.2.	You have 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 attempts.3.	You have 3 levels of complexity.You have to start from Right Brain and get 100% dominance in Right, then play the Left, Left and Right modes for all attempts and all three levels until you get 100% dominance.Then you play the Whole Brain in all attempts and levels and to master it such that your left and right is synchronised. When you play whole brain, there are both visual and auditory stimuli. You can have a lot of fun while you are training your brain too. Once you have mastered how to get the best out of your brain, you will see the difference in how you view the world, how your Spouse and friends rate you and see how you grow up the ladder of your organization as a BALANCED person. How this game can help me?While we have a natural tendency towards one way of thinking, the two sides of our brain work together in our everyday lives. The right brain of the brain focuses on the visual, and processes information in an intuitive and simultaneous way, looking first at the whole picture then the details. The focus of the left brain is verbal, processing information in an analytical and sequential way, looking first at the pieces then putting them together to get the whole.Left brain thinking is verbal and analytical. Right brain is non-verbal and intuitive, using pictures rather than words. The best illustration of this is to listen to people give directions. The left brain person will say something like “From here, go west three blocks and turn north on Vine Street. Go three or four miles and then turn east onto Broad Street.” The right brain person will sound something like this: “Turn right (pointing right), by the church over there (pointing again). Then you will pass a McDonalds and a Walmart, At the next light, turn right toward the Gas station.”Though right-brain or non-verbal thinking is often regarded as more ‘creative’, there is no right or wrong here; it is merely two different ways of thinking. One is not better than the other, just as being right-handed is not ‘superior’ to being left-handed. What is important is to be aware that there are different ways of thinking, and by knowing what your natural preference is, you can pay attention to your less dominant side to improve the same.By activating the power of both hemispheres, you will be able to retain knowledge better and become proficient in any subject, especially math.So as you now know, the human brain consists of the right brain and the left brain. The shapes of these two parts are similar, but differences have been gradually found in their functions. The left brain is also referred to as the digital brain. It controls reading and writing, calculation, and logical thinking. The right brain is referred to as the analog brain. It controls three-dimensional sense, creativity, and artistic senses. These two work together, to allow us to function as humans.So now TRAIN YOUR BRAIN";"Moneu, Scalene Entertainment Studio Private Limited, Games, Medical, Strategy, Trivia, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"1.0";12;"English";"892349900";"Scalene Entertainment Studio Private Limited";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/scalene-entertainment-studio-private-limited/id892349900?mt=8";0;NA;70,5;"Apr 6 2016";"Apr 6 2016";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;2018-10-19

We recognise that for a person to achieve their goal they may need to interact with a range of individuals and organisations.  You could use the R-U-Ontrak app to set and manage the process to achieve your life, health, educational, sporting or personal goals. The app can be used to manage a wide range of goals and multiple goals at the same time.  We focus on a goal from two main perspectives:THE GOALThis is for you if you are a person seeking to achieve a goal.THE ROLEThis is for you if you are a person who engages with those seeking to achieve a goal. You could be working as an individual or part of an organisation and have a role, such as a coach, an exercise professionals, etc. For demonstration purposes we discuss the use by a person and a coach and/or team trainer.FOR YOU THE PERSON R-U-Ontrak is a mobile app that puts control in your pocket by enabling you to set a goal, define a time period to achieve the goal, define milestones, track actions and progress and it enables you to build a community of supporters and professionals to help you achieve your goal.If you answer ""yes"" to the following questions, please take the time to download the app and use the app to manage the achievement of your goal:o	DO YOU HAVE A GOAL? To get the most out of the app your goal should be something you need to achieve, and the goal also needs to be measurable, achievable and time based.  o	DO YOU HAVE A TIME FRAME? Is the time frame realistic?  If you don't know perhaps talk with someone with expertise in the area.  o	DO YOU HAVE A PLAN?  We consider anything you do an action, it could be see your physio, go to the gym, have coffee with a friend.  We can pull data from your calendar and from Apple Health, you can set up milestones and you can adjust your progress to achieving your milestones and your goal.  As your plan evolves you can enter future actions and set up actions that repeat over the course of a day, a week or a longer period - these could go into your calendar.o	DO YOU HAVE A TEAM? If your goal is related to an injury, then the team could include healthcare professionals, although it may also include professionals in other domains such as fitness.   R-U-Ontrak enables you to enter individual tasks and milestones that reflect the components of the plans others have provided to you.  You are also able to communicate one to one or in a small group, so you could have all of your team connected to chat about aspects of your goal.o	DO YOU HAVE FIVE TO TEN MINUTES A DAY? We intend for you to use the app for no more than five to ten minutes a day.o	DO YOU CONTROL YOUR DATA? The data is only stored on your phone.
