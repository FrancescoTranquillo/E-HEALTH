"The AMD eye app is a mobile source of information for patients with age related macular degeneration (AMD) who still maintain some reading vision.

    The app is unique in that it has been developed by an ophthalmologist specializing in retina/macular diseases who has received feed back from his patients and importantly family members of AMD patients (who they themselves may be at risk for AMD due to genetic and hereditary factors). The developer in everyday retina practice has found that patients often forget, misplace or lose at home the amsler grid charts given to them by his office.
    Thus specifically this app is the 1st ophthalmology app for the AMD patient designed with the following integrated features:
          an Amsler grid which the user can schedule daily or weekly alerts.
          education and information data to patients about AMD.
          design for patients and user focus in mind rather than a resource for the healthcare professional/student/resident who need more of a reference utility.
          protects patient privacy by not allowing the upload of a patient's personal daily amsler grid recording.

"Drug Gene Budger (DGB) is a web-based application developed to assist investigators with prioritizing small molecules that are predicted to maximally influence the expression of their gene of interest. With DGB, users can enter a gene human symbol, and whether they wish to upregulate or downregulate its expression. The output of the application is a ranked list of small molecules that have been experimentally determined to produce the desired expression effect. The output table includes log-transformed fold changes and p-values for each small molecule, reporting the significance of differential expression as determined by the limma method. Relevant links are provided to further explore knowledge about the target gene, the small molecule, and the source of evidence from which the relationship between the small molecule and the target gene was derived. The experimental data contained within DGB is compiled from signatures extracted from the LINCS L1000 dataset, the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and the original Affymetrix Connectivity Map. DGB provides a useful preliminary technique for identifying small molecules that can target the expression of single genes in mammalian cells.";1

"This app brings the QRISK2-2014 cardiovascular disease risk calculator to the iPhone. It has been written by ClinRisk Ltd who provide the reference standard implementation of QRISK2 in use across the UK National Health Service.You can use this calculator to work out your risk of having a heart attack or stroke over the next ten years by answering some simple questions. It is suitable for people who do not already have a diagnosis of heart disease or stroke.Whilst QRISK2 has been developed for use in the UK, it is being used internationally. The UK version uses postcodes to map deprivation data for the algorithm. This international version allows you to interactively change the amount of deprivation with a slider. Simply press on the ""Score"" tab to reset the deprivation to a neutral value, neither rich nor poor.The QRISK2 algorithm has been developed by doctors and academics working in the UK National Health Service and is based on routinely collected data from many thousands of GPs across the country who have freely contributed data the QResearch database for medical research. It is updated annually each April, refitted to the latest data to remain as accurate as possible.The academic paper describing the risk score is in the British Medical Journal, BMJ 2008;336:1475-82, and an independent validation of the score is published later in the same journal, BMJ 2010;340:c2442.

"* High yield, multi step questions in clinical medicine ** Interactive animations and learning games ** Diagrams to summarise the most relevant parts of UK and international guidelines from the point of view of a junior doctor on call *---As students/doctors, we all want to be super productive whenever we make the sacrifice from our limited free time to learn some medicine. Some of the most effective learning Ive had is from websites like Radiology Masterclass and Life in the Fast Lane. They give you chunks of material and apply it to clinical cases, with clear explanations and visual reinforcement. With this in mind, I have made visual explanations for questions wherever possible. I have also ensured that the explanations were clear enough to be understood by various medic friends when they tried using it in the middle of the night. I also didnt want to just repeat the same questions you read everywhere. Medical education consists of bricks and cement. The bricks are the things you learn in medical school e.g. what drugs to give in hyperkalemia. The cement is what you need to know to put this into practice e.g. how fast you can give calcium gluconate and what you would practically do if the patient were also on digoxin. Medical training generally prepares us very well for rattling through the management of a STEMI in an OSCE situation, but not so much for whether or not you would actually start the ACS meds in a patient with known recurrent extensive gastritis and a GI bleed last month. We learn all about A-B-O mismatches in transfusions, and how dangerous they are, but less about how to respond to a 0.8 degree rise in temperature with a 10mmHg fall in BP 5 minutes after the transfusion starts. This app was written based my experiences as an FY1. I reflected upon these and combined the evidence, advice from seniors and going to back to basic science to work out what would be best practice for next time for these 'cement' areas of medicine. This is hopefully reflected in the questions and their explanations. I also realised how many misconceptions are commonly taught and wanted to bring attention to them e.g. V/Q mismatch is the main reason COPD patients on high flow oxygen become hypercapnic, not the hypoxic drive. Some of the answers may run against what is conventionally taught. These are all referenced with national/international guidelines. Most questions include learning points that would be helpful for MRCP and/or finals.About me:I have taught students throughout my time at medical school (Oxford and UCL) and as a Foundation Doctor, and am currently working in Academic Education as an FY2. I have been experimenting with using video based teaching in new environments see the YouTube channel (youtube.com/drcrunchvideos), kept a medical education blog (drcrunch.wordpress.com) and a SBA site (drcrunch.co.uk). I am also an associate editor of the new Survive Sepsis manual and have recently passed MRCP Part I on my first attempt with a scaled score of 857/999.";1

"The 6th Vital Sign is a national research study that aims to create a new marker of health. Powered by Apples Researchkit we use a short walking test and questions about health to create a vital sign related to how people move.   Vital signs measure the bodys basic functions. They are supposed to be easy to measure at home or at a health clinic. Just like we use body temperature to assess general health and possible illness, we can assess health with the distance someone walks over 2 minutes. If every person knew his or her walking speed as measured on a mobile phone, we could use it as a new global indicator of health. As a 6th Vital Sign, walking speed could be used to know if someone is recovering from illness or injury, declining in health, or at risk for falling, depression or even not being able to safely cross the street.   We invite you to join Duke as we:  Learn about walking speed and health as measured on a phone  Create a walking speed comparison chart by age and gender for all adults (like height and weight charts)  Predict future health and survival  Create maps of how walking speed varies by where people live  Change health care so walking speed is used a vital sign  Increase awareness of the importance of walking speed   Who can Participate?

This is the app that I wish I had during the pregnancy. There were books and websites that gave good information, but I found that there were two things that I wanted help tracking on a day to day basis. 1. What baby stuff have we acquired and what do we still need? 2. Can my wife eat _____? We ended up with papers, notes, online documents and other things to keep track of these two bits of information. It became confusing. On top of this, I had little clue as to all the stuff that was available for newborns. I picked this up over time, but it would have been nice to have this information in an easy-to-consume format. Breaking Dad helps track all of this with a bit of an irreverent attitude.

"This application can save your life!This small app transforms your iPhone or iPad into a quick-test for heart attack symptoms. The diagnosis is incredibly accurate considered the effort and cost involved. Its all based on a WHO survey system that was developed for physicians and cardiologists without access to modern medical devices. The benefits of being aware of a potential problem and having it checked out professionally afterwards are obvious, considered that heart conditions can be easily treated IF they are only diagnosed early enough!This is no small matter, since out of all deaths related to a heart attack, 30% of people were never even aware of a heart condition and simply never thought about seeing a doctor for a cardiac check-up! HEART ATTACK FACTS Heart attacks are the No.1 risk factor for adults with regard to cardiovascular disease. Each year, heart attacks kill more people than cancer. Symptoms are often misjudged or simply ignored, such as sudden pain in the chest or arms. Often, these symptoms occur because of angina pectoris (chest pain caused by lack of blood to the heart) and develop into full-grown heart attacks and possibly death if left untreated. The risk of suffering a heart attack increases with age - which makes HeartCheck a useful tool for years to come. Test yourself regularly (with HeartCheck or with a cardiologist for absolute certainty) so you know about your health. Most of us only have one lifeHeartCheck helps you to recognize the warning signals our bodies send out and eliminates the risk of having a heart attack happening to you unexpectedly in the worst possible situation (remote mountain slope, off-coast fishing trip, etc.).NOTE: This questionnaire is based on medical studies and instructions for cardiologist worldwide. However, a test like this will only be able to indicate possible outcomes but is never a substitute for a medical examination.

"This App was designed by urology faculty from the Department of Urology at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF). This App is designed for both women and men.The main (and unique!) feature of this App is its biofeedback feature, which allows users to measure the most important element of a Kegel exercise: how they spend contracting and relaxing their pelvic muscles during each exercise. Kegel Nation also lets users track how often they do their Kegel, and, other important elements of their urinary function: how often they feel urinary urgency, the number of trips to the bathroom, the number of incontinence (urinary leakage) events, and, number of urinary pads used. During treatment, it essential to accurately track these urinary function events, as this helps us (physician and patient) to determine whether there is progress over time and/or a satisfactory response to treatment with recommended changes in habits or with medications. Kegel Nation also allows users to graph all of their own Kegel exercise and urinary function data, to make it easier to see trends to either share with their doctor or for their own health charting.The target audience for this App are UCSF Department of Urology clinical study subjects who have agreed to participate in a clinical study using this App. Each subject will have given written consent to participate in the clinical study. Upon enrolling in the clinical study in our clinic, each subject will be assigned a unique Study ID number, which unlocks the downloaded App. To use the app, each subject enters their unique Study ID, which allows them to use the App. The app automatically pushes their study data to the Study database-- labeling each study subject's data with their unique Study ID-- for ""within subject"" data analysis within the study database housed upon a commercial server.That code(Study ID) is generate by Admin Panel and if anyone having this study ID than only user can use this application.

"This app contains a variety of fun games for children to play (ages 5 and up) and we measure their listening abilities while they play! This app has a quick screening option for parents and teachers, and a comprehensive testing option for appropriate professionals only. This version has been localised for England.  Please see other versions for other countries/accents.For Teachers and Parents:If you think that your child has listening, language or learning problems that might be related to auditory processing, you can use our quick screening to find out if there are any concerns.  If you are concerned, regardless of the screening results, we recommend you visit your local audiologist or speech-language pathologist and recommend this app to get your child's auditory processing abilities tested thoroughly as well as traditional hearing testing performed. This app contains a variety of fun games for children to play (ages 5 and up) and we measure their listening abilities while they play!  Your specialist can then recommend the appropriate action including treatments and strengthening exercises based on these results.For the professional:Researchers for years have shown the importance of auditory processing abilities and their correlations to language, reading, and educational abilities.  Professionals (audiologists, speech-language pathologists, educational psychologists, paediatricians, etc) have not been able to measure auditory processing abilities routinely.  There are a variety of reasons given for this; time-constraints, cost-constraints, limited knowledge on how to administer, limited knowledge on how to interpret the findings.  Now, the team at Acoustic Pioneer have created a fast, fun, and easy way to measure multiple areas of auditory processing using an iPad app!  The assessment app has been developed and normed on over 1000 children.  The results are analysed immediately and you will receive a report on the results for your client comparing their ability to that of same-aged peers and will come with recommendations including therapy options, suggestions for teachers, compensatory strategy suggestions, or other information that would be helpful."",";1
"A mindfulness app that supports real talk for our emotional wellbeing and helps us to proactively care for our mental health through talking and listening. In Fika we all have an anonymous friend to talk to about how we really feel and to support us as we work through our everyday emotions. Fika provides short, regular emotional exercises that are easy to do, safe and a great way to clear our mind, release tension, improve focus and develop new coping strategies. Connect and chat first to break the ice and make sure you are on the same wavelength, then start a Fika Free from judgement. Full of fresh perspective. Therapy helps us resolve problematic behaviors, beliefs, feelings, relationship issues, and/or somatic responses (sensations in the body) by talking them through with someone. At Fika, we believe talking through our everyday emotions with an anonymous friend, a peer, not an expert, is a valuable form of proactive therapy for our everyday emotions. Talking and listening to each other is not just about getting new perspectives from the weird and wonderful lives we all lead, but its a great, healthy way to relax, unwind, de-stress, boast or work through ideas. It can help build social skills, empathy and understanding of others. Fika is a safe, moderated community full of everyday people who enjoy the simple, therapeutic power of talking and listening to each other as a means of supporting our everyday emotional fitness. You might be a student starting university as a fresher, or an entrepreneur looking to bounce ideas off an objective sounding board, Fika is open to all. We all have a different perspective. We choose the stories we want to talk about, and those we want to listen to. From the big hits and misses of our lives to the small everyday ups and downs of our day. Even, our goals, aims and desires. We each choose our unique Fika name to protect and respect each others privacy, This way we can drop our usual guards and be refreshingly honest with each other in short-timed Fikas, which are one-to-one voice calls. Nothing we say during a Fika is recorded or stored, so we can all feel free to let it out. Each Fika is a 10 minute one-to-one call between the talker and the listener. The talker gets to share something they need to talk about, whilst the listener takes the time to really be there for someone else. To actively listen, prompt with questions and encourage their talker to discover fresh perspectives for themselves. Everyone can be a talker or a listener on Fika and we show each other the respect we all deserve. Everybody's story is significant. Everybody's story deserves to be heard. The Fika community is focussed on positive, proactive emotional wellness. It is built on trust and respect for each others stories and privacy.

"Carburetor v2.1 marks the continuing evolution of diabetes management by tracking glucose readings, medication dosages, carbohydrate consumption, exercise and HbA1c results. While there are other diabetes apps with similar functionality, Carburetor is the fastest and easiest. For example, it only takes a few touches to enter a blood glucose reading. A few more to enter medications or carbohydrates. Carburetor was designed to focus on stream-lining the user experience and avoid flipping through endless menus. Whether you have type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes, Carburetor is the ""must have"" app for diabetes tracking and diabetes management which features the new and easy to interpret glucose readings logbook chart. This logbook view was inspired by a leading Endocrinologist at UCSF Medical Center. Where identifying patterns is key to consistent and controlled glucose management.WHAT Carburetor DOES:* Log blood glucose readings, medications, carbohydrates, exercise activities and HbA1c Results* New Statistics view. Shows 7, 14, 30 and 90 days blood glucose averages, Medications and Carbs. Click any blood glucose statistic and it changes to average calculated HbA1C.* Daily blood glucose average.* Although the date defaults to the current date and time, Carburetor allows setting the date and time to anything* Blood glucose in mg/dL or mmol/L* Enter and save glucose readings, medications, carbohydrates, exercise and HbA1c results in just a few touches* Customize the list of medications and exercises* Include notes on each log entry.

All they tell you is you had a high or low but it doesn't tell you WHY! The WHY is why we bother tracking all this stuff. The new Blood Glucose Readings Log Book Chart tells you WHY! If you're problem is a lot of highs, then filter out everything except the highs to see your ""pattern"" of highs.It's a free download so please check it out and let me know how you like Carburetor.

"This app contains a variety of fun games for children to play (ages 5 and up) and we measure their listening abilities while they play! This app has a quick screening option for parents and teachers, and a comprehensive testing option for appropriate professionals only. This version has been localised for England. Please see other versions for other countries/accents. For Teachers and Parents: If you think that your child has listening, language or learning problems that might be related to auditory processing, you can use our quick screening to find out if there are any concerns. If you are concerned, regardless of the screening results, we recommend you visit your local audiologist or speech-language pathologist and recommend this app to get your child's auditory processing abilities tested thoroughly as well as traditional hearing testing performed. This app contains a variety of fun games for children to play (ages 5 and up) and we measure their listening abilities while they play! Your specialist can then recommend the appropriate action including treatments and strengthening exercises based on these results. For the professional: Researchers for years have shown the importance of auditory processing abilities and their correlations to language, reading, and educational abilities. Professionals (audiologists, speech-language pathologists, educational psychologists, paediatricians, etc) have not been able to measure auditory processing abilities routinely. There are a variety of reasons given for this; time-constraints, cost-constraints, limited knowledge on how to administer, limited knowledge on how to interpret the findings. Now, the team at Acoustic Pioneer have created a fast, fun, and easy way to measure multiple areas of auditory processing using an iPad app! The assessment app has been developed and normed on over 1000 children. The results are analysed immediately and you will receive a report on the results for your client comparing their ability to that of same-aged peers and will come with recommendations including therapy options, suggestions for teachers, compensatory strategy suggestions, or other information that would be helpful.";1

"Identifying the critically ill patient is a major challenge at hospitals. Unrecognized deterioration of patients is estimated to cost more than 100.000 lives per year in the US alone. It is not only important to identify the critically ill patient but also to communicate the situation to the rest of the hospital staff involved. The Early Warning Score (EWS) is a simple clinical score that can be used by hospital medical staff as well as emergency medical services to quickly determine the degree of illness of a patient. It is based on data derived from four physiological readings (systolic blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, body temperature) and the observation of the level of consciousness (AVPU). The resulting observations are compared to a normal range to generate a single composite score. A score of five or more is statistically linked to increased likelihood of death or admission to an intensive care unit. Different EWS systems are in use worldwide and the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK has e.g. decided to introduce a nation-wide NHS Early Warning Score to achieve the goal of having the right person, in the right setting  first time! Within hospitals, the EWS is often used as part of a &quot;track-and-trigger&quot; system whereby an increasing score produces an escalated response varying from increasing the frequency of patient's observations up to urgent review by a rapid response or Medical Emergency Team (MET call).

"Amblyopia, otherwise known as lazy eye, is a disorder of the visual system that is characterized by poor or lack of vision in an eye that is otherwise physically normal, or out of proportion to associated structural abnormalities. It has been estimated to affect 15% of the population. Amblyopia means that visual stimulation either fails to transmit or is poorly transmitted through the optic nerve to the brain for a continuous period of time. It often occurs during early childhood, resulting in poor or dim vision. Amblyopia normally affects only one eye, but it is possible to be amblyopic in both eyes if both fail to receive good, clear visual images.

"How can you &quot;drink responsibly&quot; if you don't know how much alcohol you are really drinking? Warnings about harmful alcohol use typically use standard units. That can be confusing to most people, who are not going to take the time to convert alcohol by volume (ABV%) and ounces or milliliters into these standard units. Track your drinks with the TSM Drink Log and let the app calculate that for you. Create Drinks Whether you're a beer, wine, or liquor drinker, you can add your drink to your own custom list and save it for easy entry later on. Add a name, the ABV%, and create different sizes in oz or ml. The TSM Drink Log will convert the information to standard drinks (sd) based on your geographic area. Medication Tracking and Reminders If you are using the TSM Drink Log with the Sinclair Method, you can log your medication time with one touch and edit the quantity if your doctor has recommended taking less than a full dose. Logging medication sets an alarm for the minimum wait time - the built-in timer is set for 60 minutes if you have been prescribed naltrexone and 120 minutes if you have been prescribed nalmefene. (Prescription medication should only be obtained through your doctor according to all local and Federal laws. Follow your doctor's instructions for any medication use.) Chart Alcohol Reduction Progress Logged drinks automatically update your drink reduction chart. If you are on TSM and would like to see your overall reduction for treatment, input your &quot;pre-TSM&quot; drinks/week average in the Settings for &quot;Week 0.&quot; This chart makes it easy to show your medical provider your progress during follow-up appointments.

"The effects of a diet or exercise program can be verified only through accurate biometric. This application will help you calculate your Body Mass Index (BMI), waist / height, body fat percentage and lean body mass. The calculator also estimates the amount of calories and protein needed for your activity level. The balance between the number of calories in the food we eat and the number of calories you consume determines our body if we drop or gain weight. The excess calories are usually stored as body fat. To maintain a constant weight, the number of calories in our diet should be equal to the number of calories you use through exercise, which are excreted as waste, fat, menstrual flow, ejaculations, or used for renewal of skin, hair, nails, and other organs. To lose weight, we must consume less calories than our body needs. In this way, body fat provides a portion of the calories they need. How to Measure  Height : measured without shoes  Weight : taken in the morning without clothes after going to the bathroom and before eating or drinking anything  Waist (Men) : measure horizontally, at the level of the navel  Waist (Women) : measure horizontally, at the level of minimal abdominal width  Neck : measure below the larynx with the tape sloping slightly downward to the front  Hips (Women only) : Largest horizontal circumference around the hips Consult a doctor or dietitian before starting any diet, especially if you take drugs.";0

"The whole Mediterranean diet is based on the scientific observation that the populations among Crete, Greece and southern Italy have the lowest rates of chronic disease, as well as one of the longest life expectancies. The Mediterranean diet may help you lose weight, offer cancer prevention, diabetes management, and most importantly brain &amp; cardiovascular health. It is very similar to every other &quot;healthy&quot; diet, since most other ones draw their inspiration from this diet. You will eat lots of vegetables, whole-grains, legumes and nuts, fruits, fish, some poultry &amp; low-fat dairy, tons of olive oil &amp; herbs/spices, a few weekly eggs, and some wine (if that's your thing). On the other hand, you will restrict red meat, saturated fats, sweets, and processed foods. The Mediterranean diet is so good for you health because you are getting ample amounts of healthy fats (olive oil, fish, nuts), vitamins, antioxidants &amp; fiber (fruits, veggies, herbs/spices, whole grains and legumes). Conversely you are removing foods that have been scientifically studied to increase our risk of disease like saturated fat and processed sugar. Even if you ignore the observational aspect of the Mediterranean populations' longevity, the diet is basically what medical doctors and nutritionist will recommended to you because it is nutritionally solid and does not require crazy restrictions or abnormal eating habits. This is a NO-BS guide to the Mediterranean Diet. Other guides have poor quality information and terrible grammar. We personally researched all of the most accurate and scientific info, and collected it in this App. The Mediterranean Diet Guide covers: -The Basics: Plants, Olive Oil and some Fish -The Benefits: Weight loss, improved cardiovascular health, prevent cancer, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disease like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's -Dangers and Side-Effects: Not really, its a healthy diet overall -FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions -How to Get Started -Foods: Allowed foods and daily servings -Foods: Avoid These Specifics -Tips To Staying On Track -Recipe Links Let us know what you would like to see added and please share, Thanks!";1

"Dose Calculator (DoseCalc) is a utility for rapid calculation of parameters associated with the use of radioisotopes.  Common users include Nuclear Medicine Physicians and Technologists, researchers in biomedical imaging, workers in radiation and health safety, and industrial users of radioisotopes. The basic dose calculation tool has five editable fields: 1) the isotope,  2) the time that the amount of activity is initially measured     (the calibration time),  3) the amount initially measured (the calibration dose),  4) the time the radioisotope is used (the administration     time),  5) the amount of radioactivity left when used (the     administration dose). 6) the volume (arbitrary units) of the calibration dose 7) the volume of the adminstration doseThe basic concept is to select the isotope, enter any three of the remaining fields and calculate the fourth. Touching the displayed value in any one of the five fields will bring up an appropriate keypad or picker to enter a new value.  The other field values will then turn red (indicating they may no longer be valid) until the user touches one of the six calculation buttons (Cal Time, Cal Dose, Admin Time, Admin Dose, 'Cal Vol' or 'admin Vol').  Changing the isotope value results in recalculation of the administration dose field as appropriate for the new half-life value associated with the selected isotope. DoseCalc comes with the following isotopes defined: C-11, Co-57, Co-60, Cu-64, Ga-67, Ga68, F-18, Ge-68, H-3, Ho166, I-123, I-124, I-125, I-131, In-111, Lu177, Mo-99, N-13, O-15, P-32, Rb-82, Re186, Re188, Tc-94, Tc-99m, Tl-201, Xe-133, and Y-90.

Version 2 adds the ability for the user to edit the isotope list.For more information on using the application, visit the PawDuction software web site";1

It is made by a practicing medical doctor and also an awarded software developer. This is his alternative to the expensive medical softwares out there. It is compatible to any specialty and any country (that uses the english alphabet) because the pop-up databases are customizable. Regarding its Electronic Medical Records function: Patient Files is not a web dependent patient keeper. This means the data will be only saved in the device and not in the cloud. The advantages are as follows: 1. There will only be a one-time payment and no monthly subscription fee that will be asked. 2. It is not dependent on the presence of an internet connection for you to use it. So you can instantly use it anywhere from clinics to wards to anywhere. Patient Files contains lots of pop-up buttons so you wont need to type common words again and again (ex. Medicines, diagnosis, complains, etc). You can send a full database from an iOS device to another iOS devices (iPhone or iPad) wirelessly via Airdrop technology. You may choose to overwrite or merge the databases during this process. It has a free desktop companion found at www.easyclinicsoftware.com. Meaning the files you have in the Desktop version can be synced to the iOS version. This can be done via email attachment, through Dropbox, through iFunbox, Desktop Connect via wifi or Wifi sync (pls. carefully follow the videos in the website mentioned on how to do this).

To make a rough estimate,if there about 60,000 recorded visits already it will just occupy around 60MB. Taking photos of course will add some memory, these will be the breakdown: setting the taking of photos to Thumb-size will get about 30kb per image. Thumb-sized photos is good for patients profile photo. 1GB of memory can give you 34,000 photos already. Note: Kindly set the size of the images to Thumbsize from the start so you won't use up much memory in your device. To do that: 1.Tap Home at upper left 2. Tap the Settings Gear Icon at bottom, middle. 3. Tap Settings 4. At External Image Photo Quality, choose Small-Thumbnail Size 5. Tap Settings, upper left 6. Tap Done, upper right.

"This App is created to help you PASS the Acupuncture Licensing Exam: in the USA: the CALE: California Acupuncture Licensing Exam and the National Exam; as well as licensing exams in Canada, Europe and other countries. Although exam format may be different in each country, the TCM concepts in acupuncture, herbs, foundation, diagnosis and formulas are the same. If you can score 75% on the practice exam within 90 minutes, you have mastered the knowledge and skills to pass the exam. This app is designed to highlight key points that may appear on the exams and also summarize points that are not explicitly explained in text books. For example, the sequence of channels & points starting from the center line at the front: Ren17, Kid23, ST17, PC1, SP18, GB23, GB22; Asthma: deficiency case use UB13, excess case use Ding Chuan; the 2 extra meridians that cross point GB20 are Yang Qiao and Yang Wei; the common herbs in Wu Ling San and Zhu Ling Tang are Fu Ling, Zhu Ling and Ze Xie; Yang Ming Channel vs. Yang Ming Fu Organ disease: the key differentiating point is that Yang Ming Fu Organ disease has constipation because heat binds with stools and Yang Ming Channel disease doesnt. Basically we turn your smart phone into an electronic flash card device to make it possible for you to study for the Acupuncture Licensing Exams whenever and wherever you like. Lots of materials are FREE (about 30% of each category is FREE) and you can also purchase the full version whenever you see the value of this app. Donation is appreciated and will be used towards growing organic herbs for Acupuncture and TCM practitioners. This app can minimize your studying time and increase your chance of PASSING the Acupuncture Licensing Exams. We welcome feedback, so we can further improve this app for you. Best wishes and Good Luck on your exam!";0

"Backdrop is an interactive 'Draw & Tell' app designed to enable and enhance professional communication with children. Most professionals who work with children have their preferred drawing tasks and activities, many of which depend on an image or Backdrop upon which children draw and write. Now you can recreate those activities by making a Backdrop to suit your specific task. Backdrops can be imported, or customised within the app. We have provided a few to give you some ideas, but your needs and creativity will determine how you use this app. You can reuse and adapt Backdrops you have created, and save the results of childrens drawing and writing. The iPad is a perfect tool for professionals working with children. It is unobtrusive, and easily introduced into sessions. It also engages children positively and greatly enhances rapport. This is particularly important for those who work with children therapeutically or for the purposes of assessment with respect to difficult or stressful issues. However, although children are pleased to interact with a tablet, there is a risk that it might act as a distraction, moving the focus away from the intended work of the session. Backdrop (and the other apps from C & FT) addresses this difficulty. Simply by interacting with a carefully designed backdrop and child friendly tools, children can work together with a professional to communicate and support a verbal narrative on a specific topic. They can make statements about their personal experiences, wishes or feelings. The product of the work of a child can be saved as snapshot at any time, to be printed for the child to keep, or for the professional to incorporate into a report. Entirely new backdrops can be created, saved and reused.";1

The NIH Toolbox includes over 200 measures, for stand-alone use or as part of a complete assessment battery.

"Tobacco use is the most common preventable cause of death. About half of the people who don't quit smoking will die of smoking-related problems. Quitting smoking is important for your health. Soon after you quit, your circulation begins to improve, and your blood pressure starts to return to normal. Your sense of smell and taste return, and it's easier for you to breathe. In the long term, giving up tobacco can help you live longer. Your risk of getting cancer decreases with each year you stay smoke-free. Quitting is not easy. You may have short-term affects such as weight gain, irritability, and anxiety. Some people try several times before they succeed. There are many ways to quit smoking. Some people stop ""cold turkey."" Others benefit from step-by-step manuals, counseling, or medicines or products that help reduce nicotine addiction.

"No need to fidget with your phone to record breastfeeding anymore. Nursing Notes helps you track breastfeeding your baby hands-free with Amazon Alexa and on-the-go with this app. Keep track of how long it has been, on which side you started, and the duration of each feeding. Nursing notes automatically syncs data between multiple devices so your co-parent, grandparents, or other caretakers can know how long it has been since your baby ate (and let you know when it is time to come back and feed them). Your data is backed up automatically in the cloud so when you drop your phone in the toilet, you won't lose your data. The app works without internet access so you can still record feedings during long flights or out-of-cell-coverage weekend trips. To get started with Alexa, youll need to enable the Nursing Notes skill and log in with your Amazon account. You can then start using voice commands to log feedings: Alexa, tell nursing notes to start on the left/right. Alexa, tell nursing notes to pause/resume. Alexa, tell nursing notes to stop. Alexa, ask nursing notes how long. Alexa, ask nursing notes for status. This app and the Alexa skill function independently (you can use one without the other), but youll have the best experience using both together. This app was designed with love by a breastfeeding mother. Let us know if you have any comments or suggestions. We hope you enjoy it. Happy feeding!";1

"Emergency health care plans (EHCP) are important records of what patients want to be done in the event of a sudden illness. EHCP are created and agreed upon by the patient, their family and health professionals providing clear, personalised instructions of what types of care should be provided in the event of an emergency. Information is also given about who usually looks after the patient and who to inform of their admission to hospital. Although copies of this plan are often given to the patient, their family and local hospital notes, these can easily be forgotten, misplaced or may not be available due to the patient being out of area. When rushing to hospital, the two things you are most likely to remember are your keys and mobile phone, not necessarily paperwork such as the EHCP. This mean can mean that the EHCP may not be found or used for several days in some cases. This app aims to make sure that you always have a copy of this important plan to hand in case of emergency. The app allows patients to upload an image of their EHCP to either be displayed directly on their phone, or sent via email to health care professionals. This improves communication and empowers the patient by making sure everyone knows their wishes in the event of an emergency.";1

I am thankful that I had an early version of Burp on my phone when I gave birth to my daughter or else I would have never been able to keep track of all the breast feedings and bottles. We had a rough start, with my daughter failing to gain weight at a reasonable pace. At one point we were feeding every two hours and then giving her a bottle of either expressed milk or formula and going to the pediatrician multiple times a week for a weigh-in and lactation appointment. Our pediatrician and lactation consultant would always ask how long is she feeding and how many extra ounces was she taking from a bottle. Thanks goodness I had Burp, as with no sleep, I could barely remember anything from hours earlier. Burp didn't make the act of breastfeeding any easier (oh how I wish), but it at least gave me the peace of mind that I didn't have to remember everything, except of course, getting that all important burp at the end.

About: The Competency & Credentialing Institute offers the CNOR (Certified Nurse Operating Room) exam as way to certify that a nurse is qualified to work in an operating room setting. It shows that a nurse is familiar with the best practices for patient care before, during, and after surgery. Prerequisites for taking the CNOR include two years and 2400 hours of professional practice as an operating room nurse. Applicants must also be a licensed registered nurse and be currently working as a nurse in an operating room setting. A bachelor of science degree in nursing is not necessary. The Competency and Credentialing Institute (CCI) developed the CNOR exam with Prometric, a subsidiary of Educational Testing Service. Prometric offers the computer-based exam throughout the United States and Canada. The test includes 200 multiple-choice questions that must be completed within four hours. Individual versions of the CNOR exam may vary in difficulty, but this is taken into account during the scoring process. About 90% of the CNOR questions concern patient care management, and the remaining 10% focus on management of operating room materials, personnel, and services. Typical topics include asepsis maintenance; healthy workplace practices; instrument selection and processing; patient freedom from harm; sponges, sharps, and instruments; patient assessment and diagnosis; patient positioning; pharmacology (including anesthetics); education and support of patient and family; ambulatory surgery; special populations; and legal, regulatory, legislative, and professional issues. After applying for and scheduling the CNOR test, Prometric sends an authorization to test. Registrants receive an authorization number as well as the web address and telephone number for scheduling the CNOR exam. When taking the exam, registrants must present two forms of identification. Test-takers should try to answer all questions and leave nothing blank on the CNOR exam. On the computer, users can mark certain questions and return to them later during the exam. People who are not familiar with computerized tests may take a tutorial on a computer before taking the actual exam. Critical test results become available immediately after the CNOR exam. Users will be informed immediately if they have passed the test, although they will not receive any scoring details. Additional scoring information will be included with the official, mailed notification that the user passed the CNOR exam.";1

"7Breaths is an application to make measuring the respiratory rate clinically (i.e. by a person watching) easy.

Medical dogma says that the respiratory rate must be measured over 1 minute. We wonder if this can be challenged. It is common practise to sample over 30 or even 15 seconds and then multiply up. But the accuracy is going to be very dependant on the actual respiratory rate. I.e. slow rates will have higher errors with 15 second samples.

We wondered if measuring over a fixed number of breaths (maybe 7) will account for these differences in sampling. So this app has been put out there in the first instance to collect lots of data over the full one minute sampling. We can then use that data to determine if counting just 7 breaths works.

We are grateful to everyone that volunteers and helps us with this project.";1
"Today the biggest fear of many women is breast cancer. With staggering statistics of over a million women being diagnosed each year, it is not hard to understand why there is this shadow of worry. 
Probably the most severe form of treatment and unfortunately the most common in years gone by is surgery. And any surgery can be stressful, but breast surgery that may indicate a need for follow-up breast cancer treatment can be extremely stressful for any woman. Hypnosis for breast cancer focuses specifically on this extreme stress. The calmer you are in any situation, the more resources your body and mind have to heal themselves as quickly as possible. Common sense, as well as research data, indicates that recovery from breast cancer is better if the patient receives emotional support during and after the treatment.
This app is specially designed to help you cope better with all the problems and issues that a woman undergone breast cancer treatment may have. The power of the subconscious mind can be a potent ally in healing from surgery and recovering from breast cancer, for it is the subconscious mind that controls automatic body processes, including immune function and pain perception. Additionally, the subconscious mind is the source of all emotions, which also makes hypnosis a logical choice for dealing with the emotional aspects of breast cancer diagnosis and treatment.

"Speech Trainer 3-D is a unique application created specifically to help individuals with speech-sound disorders and English language learners. Speech Trainer 3-D provides an animated video model for both consonants and vowel sounds. With both a side and front view, Speech Trainer 3-D provides 32 English language sounds: 23 consonants and 8 vowels. Designed by a certified speech-language pathologist, Speech Trainer 3-D is perfect for those individuals struggling with sound production and for use by SLPs, special educators, and parents alike.
Purpose
Speech Trainer 3-D was created to be used as a therapy tool to assist individuals in correctly producing target sounds. Speech Trainer incorporates both an animated video of the speech sound as well as a systematic breakdown for describing the movements necessary for each sound. Both video modeling and video prompting are useful for many individuals when learning new skills1. 
In addition to the animated video model, Speech Trainer 3-D uses the camera function built into the iPad 2 and higher to allow the learner to see a side-by-side picture of the model and his or her own face making the sound. Incorporating the built-in camera allows the professional to utilize both a visual and a tactile prompt for the client, which may in turn, encourage longer productions and improve the muscle coordination needed for speech2. 
How to Use
Speech Trainer 3-D is designed to be used individually or in group practice. Once the app is loaded, the user can choose whether to work on consonants or vowels. When a phoneme type has been selected, the app will open with a phoneme bar along the top of the page and the side-view of a model of the speech mechanism. For consonants, the user can simply slide the selection bar sideways to access all of the consonant sounds. When the phoneme is selected, a *play* arrow is tapped and the video model moves while the sound is produced. To hear the systematic breakdown of movements, a double *fast-forward* arrow is pushed. A square will surround the area being discussed. Subsequent taps on the double arrow will move to the next prompt. 
The app opens in a default side-view; however, a frontal view is available. In this view, the speech-mechanism model is replaced with a person modeling the sounds. The app also provides an audio example of 2-4 words for each sound. 
The iPad camera is activated when the iPad is rotated to the landscape position. At that time, the user will see their image in the camera beside the avatar. The user will then be able to use the video modeling to make encourage accurate production of sounds. 

Customization
Speech Trainer 3-D allows the user to specify which sound in the English language to target. Transitioning between multiple sounds is easily accomplished with the tap of a button. Changing from the side medical model of the speech mechanism to the mirror like human model is done with a quick tap. Finally, adding a self-monitoring component is encouraged by simply rotating the iPad and engaging the iPad's built-in camera.

Features
*Full color medical model of the speech mechanism
*Systematic breakdown of each phoneme with video
*32 English phonemes: 23 consonants and 8 vowels
*Both side and frontal views for demonstrating the sound
*Built-in camera feature to encourage self-monitoring

Speech Trainer 3D demonstrates the sounds in two views: Front and Side View. Speech Trainer uses the International Phonetics Alphabet, which is the best way to represent each sound. 
Speech Trainer has 30 sounds represented; 23 consonants and 7 vowels.";1

"SAH DCI calculates the risk for delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) based on several classification systems that are published in scientific journals.

The basic module calculates 3 parameters. It uses the WFNS SAH score and the modified Fisher score to calculate the VASOGRADE risk category.[1,2]

The advanced module calculates 7 parameters. It uses some more input parameters and also calculates the BEHAVIOR score and the risk chart category as published by De Rooij et al.[3,4] In both modules, a report can be sent by email that includes all user-entered parameters and a full report as displayed in the app.

This app has been developed and tested by a neurosurgeon, and incorporates CE-marked technology for risk minimization inspired by the European MEDDEV guidelines and FDA guidance on mobile medical applications.

"This software provides the user a handy tool to establish staging for esophageal carcinoma.  It is based on the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Seventh Edition scheme and represents the most up to date formulation.  There are several major changes to the current staging model that bring a more rational approach to the classification, based on more than just the tumor size, nodal stations, and the presence of metastatic disease.  Analyses have determined an important contribution to prognosis based on histology, histologic grade, numbers of lymph nodes, and, in some cases, the anatomic location of the primary tumor.  This most recent staging tool represents the fruits of those analyses.

"Diabetes * don't let this dangerous chronic disease destroy your life. Assess your risk now and take preventive action if necessary.
  
 There are three major types of diabetes: type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, and gestational diabetes. All three types of diabetes share the same basic characteristic -- the body's inability either to make or to use insulin. Your body needs insulin, a hormone, to be able to use glucose, which comes from the food you eat, for energy. Without enough insulin, glucose stays in the blood, creating high levels of blood sugar. Over time, this build up causes damage to your kidneys, heart, nerves, eyes, and other organs.
 Diabetes has reached epidemic proportions and become a major health problem in many countries throughout the world. The number of adults with diabetes worldwide has more than doubled since 1980 to 347 million. It is estimated to be four times as common as all forms of cancer combined.
 In the US, 25.8 million people (8.3% of the population) have diabetes. Of these, 7.0 million have undiagnosed diabetes. In 2010, about 1.9 million new cases of diabetes were diagnosed in people aged 20 years or older.
 Some 2.8m people in the UK have been diagnosed with diabetes and an estimated 850,000 more probably have type 2 diabetes but don't yet know. Another 7m are classified as high-risk of developing diabetes.
  
 Many individuals are currently at risk of developing type 2 diabetes because of lifestyle and other factors. Are you one of them?
  
 Asses your risk by answering a few simple questions.
  
 Individuals at risk can take preventive action now (see app for details) that will significantly reduce their chances of developing this dangerous chronic disease.";1

"The operating room (OR) remains primarily a master/apprentice-based learning environment for surgical residents. This app puts into practice a simple model for teaching and assessing residents in the OR to guide faculty and resident interaction and to help determine a trainee's earned level of autonomy for a given procedure. It is based on an original paper published out of Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and the University of Kentucky College of Medicine (Debra A. DaRosa, PhD, Joseph B. Zwischenberger, MD, Shari L. Meyerson, MD, et al. A Theory-Based Model for Teaching and Assessing Residents in the Operating Room, Journal of Surgical Education, Volume 70(1), 2012.)
 
 The resident surgeon initiates the assessment by logging the date, type of procedure, attending surgeon and hospital. (S)he is then asked to self rate their level of participation (Zwisch option) and the degree of difficulty of the procedure. This information is transmitted by SMS to the attending surgeon who then provides his or her Zwisch option, degree of difficulty, operative performance, and procedural milestone data for the same case, with no knowledge of the resident's contribution. The attending surgeon's assessment is then stored along with the resident's assessment for future analysis.
 
 The app is functional only for university programs that have adopted this assessment tool.";1

"The App is for healthcare professionals either looking for locum work or healthcare practice owners offering locum work. It is a platform to bring the locums in direct contact with the practices. 

There will be two types of users, Locums and Practice owners/managers.

Each user must register before using the App. They will enter basic details and an optional photo for their profiles. Admin will have access to this information which can be verified to activate their profiles.

All the functions of the App appear when you click the top left hand corner of the App. There is a drop down box of all the features.

The practices have access to the locum database. They can search the database and message a specific locum or view the locums profile to get access to their contact details. The other option the practice has is to use the booking system. They can post a job, the job will then be accessible to view by all the locums. They can also offer a job to specific locums instead of posting it on the general jobs board. Locums can then accept or reject the jobs offered to them. If locums apply for a job it comes up on the pending jobs tab for the practices. Once they have confirmed the pending application it appears on the scheduled section of the jobs tab. And once completed they can close the job to be placed in the completed tab.

The locums can register and then view all the jobs on the jobs board. They can click on the job and then message the practice directly or apply for the job. If the job has been applied for it falls into the pending tab and will only go onto the confirmed tab when the practice has confirmed they accept the application. The locums will also receive messages from the practices and can reply from the message section if they wish to do so.

The practices can search the locum database using different search criteria to search for specific locums that may suit them. They can search the criteria using 2 different search methods. They can search locums by distance from their practice and alphabetical order.

The locums can search jobs by different search criteria to search specific jobs or to list the jobs in a specific order. They can search by rate of pay, search by date or specific date.

The home page is a calendar. The calendar can be viewed in a weekly planner or a monthly planner. The dates where jobs are pending are in bold and then when the date is clicked the job appears at the bottom. You can change the calendar view to view all scheduled jobs by clicking on the scheduled button on the top right hand corner, the calendar will then show all scheduled jobs.

The users can get notifications of pending jobs. All locums can also update their availability.

There is also a contact page with an email address. This is to contact admin for any queries, you can email directly from the page.";1

Whats the difference between Medyear Plus and Medyear Basic? 
Medyear Plus has all of the features of Basic. However, as a Medyear Plus user, youll also get access to a large network of over 700K doctors that you can communicate with through secure email. Medyear Plus users can also request their medical records from those 700K doctors with a digital HIPAA release.
 
Can I upgrade from Medyear Basic to Plus? 
Yes. You can upgrade at any time. 
 
How do I get my medical records?
For Medyear Basic users, simply provide your patient portal credentials for any of the up to 200 participating hospitals where youve received care, and your records will be imported automatically into your Medyear app. If you have Medyear Plus, you can also request medical records directly from any of the 700K doctors in our directory using the digital HIPAA release feature.
 
What is a Direct address?
Direct is a secure email protocol for medical communications. Medyear is the first company to provide patients with the same type of Direct email capability that doctors use. With a Medyear Plus account, you receive a custom Direct address with yourname@plus.medyear.com. It works a lot like an email, but has enhanced security for medical communication.
 
How can I share my medical records?
Sharing medical information is a delicate act. Medyear allows you to share your medical records in a private message with the doctors you choose, giving you control over your health data's portability. If youre a Medyear Basic user, you can share individual parts of your medical record in a chat. If youre a Medyear Plus user, you can also share an entire medical record file (CCD) in a secure email message to your doctor. This is handy for transferring medical information between old and new physicians.

Stress, depression, anxiety, irritability, trouble sleeping these are common experiences for tinnitus sufferers.  The Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI), a key feature of the Levo System, is a tool to determine the level of tinnitus severity and impact. Use the TFI now to measure sleep quality, the ability to relax, emotional impact and quality of life. After using Levo, take the TFI again to determine the level of improvement with therapy.YOUR UNIQUE SOUND, YOUR UNIQUE THERAPYLike no two fingerprints are the same, no two people have the same tinnitus sound. The Levo System identifies, recreates and maps your unique sound print to create a personalized therapy based on your needs as an individual. By listening to your sound print nightly while sleeping, your brain naturally learns to ignore the perceived sound of tinnitus, diminishing its impact over time.UNDERSTANDING TINNITUSWhile tinnitus is perceived in the ear, it actually occurs as a result of false signaling in the brain. The good news is that the brain has a profound ability to learn and create new signals. Utilizing that ability is key to tinnitus management.Designed by a team of worldclass neuroscientists, clinicians and patients, Levo is used nightly to leverage the brains natural cognitive abilities.SAFETY FIRSTFDA 510(k) clearedCE MarkCSA CertifiedISO 13485 CertifiedHealth Canada";NA

"Welcome to Eye Tracker!For some years I have been giving children exercises to develop smooth and accurate eye movements, as well as assisting other systems of the body. I found that once the eyes started to move better, the child began to improve in their rate of advancing through reading levels and those who were becoming, or had become, disengaged from the learning process suddenly reconnected.I have been very excited to see the changes in people as they no longer see themselves as dumb and move from needing to be in remedial class to being part of the regular class. Doing this work only allowed me to reach one person at a time. One of my clients wondered if there was some way that I could make my program readily available to the general population. The Eye Tracker App has been developed in response.Eye Tracker was developed using the principles of neuroplasticity and muscle movement remediation. Every time you experience something or do an activity there are changes to your nervous system. For some people, during early development, the nerves and muscles that move the eyes dont develop in an optimal way. A person can be left with eye movements that are not as smooth and accurate as is needed for reading, tracking a ball in motion or copying from a white/black board. This can result in:- regularly jumping over the little words like is, if, a, I, am, at etc. - joining letters from one word to another because they are not seeing the breaks where they should be; or- a line of text is not nice and straight but broken. Refer to the Eye Tracker website (www.eyetracker.net.au) for more detail and an example of this.The vestibular-ocular reflex is important for the smooth movement of the eyes. This reflex goes from the vestibular system to the cerebellum and then to the eyes. It allows you to maintain your focus on a point even when your head is moving. This is an automatic process. The cerebellum also happens to be a significant part of the brain when it comes to reading. If this reflex is not working as well as it should, or the wiring of the cerebellum for its role in reading is not optimal, then there is a good chance that you will have difficulty reading.A person can do all the remedial reading programs in the world but if their eyes are not moving as well as they could be then they are limiting these other good programs. The development of Eye Tracker also enables people in remote areas or with limited finances to now have the opportunity to work on fixing this one area that significantly impacts their ability to read.TESTIMONIALS FOR EYE TRACKERJaryd was becoming disengaged from school, finding reading difficult and was consistently in trouble... His latest reports have good comments about his participation, leadership, willingness to help others and being a joy to teach brought tears to my eyes. He is enjoying school - yay!Cherie Johnston (Ormeau)Over the past 6 months of doing the eye exercises twice daily, we have seen a huge improvement in Lachlans writing, his concentration, his reading and listening skills have improved as well.

"Get rid of the beer belly with this awesome 15 Minutes Total Body Active Workout Challenge. Moreover, work from home!! This is a great way to get a good muscle burn without doing a really high intensity cardio workout. 

With the Active-Static style of training you have a group of two different exercises that use a similar position and utilize the same muscle groups. For example, the first group of exercises in the workout video are a traditional push up and a plank. Both of these exercises utilize almost identical muscle groups, actually the only muscle group that is not used by both exercises is the triceps which is more predominately used in the push up and is either not used or only lightly used depending on the style of plank you choose to do.

The term static means lack of movement. And as this term implies, with static training you take a weight and hold it in a fixed position for several seconds. This concept is based on the idea that by forcing the muscle to work only when it is maximally contracted and using the heaviest weight possible, you can optimize its growth potential. You have to admit that it makes sense. The question is, does it work?

The answer is yes; it does work when used properly. This is due mainly to the overload that's involved, as well as to the unique stimulus with which it jolts the muscle.

When you train using a full ROM, the amount of weight you can use is limited by your sticking pointthe point in the exercise ROM where you're weakest. You can only use as much weight as you can lift through that sticking point. With static contractions, you eliminate the sticking point, so you can overload the muscle fibers with as much weight as you can hold for at least 10 seconds in a particular muscle's strongest position.

Static contraction training may seem like a new concept, but it's hardly a radical, untested training philosophy.";1

"""The plank is one of the best exercises you can do for your core because it builds isometric strength to help sculpt your waistline and improve your posture. And depending on the type of plank you try, you can also engage your back, arms, shoulders, glutes, and hamstrings. Win!

Practice: Perform planks several times each day, trying to hold the position a little longer each time.
Use body-weight exercises: The plank workout will improve your core strength.
Squat and deadlift: Guys who are strong in these specific lifts find planks are no problem.

HOLD IT
If you don't have the core strength yet to do a regular plank, you can build up to it by doing a bent-knee plank. If you can hold a plank for more than two minutes with ease, you can move on to these tougher variations.

Ways to improve your plank time
The longer you can hold the plank, the more resilient your lower back will be to injury, and the better your abs will look once you burn the fat off them. Follow these tips for longer plank times.

"""PaceBoss is the world's first sophisticated audio biofeedback system. The system will advise you when to adjust your pace, and if you don't comply, the system will advise you more insistently. This will go on until the system feels that you simply won't comply, at which point PaceBoss will advise you that's it giving up and begins monitoring you at whatever pace your moving at that time - just like a human being. But, the best value with PaceBoss is the celebrity voices. What could be more motivating than to be guided through your exercise regimen by the very person who most inspires you in life?

"****I liked everything about this app! My students were engaged with the activities, and it targets all of the prepositions that I need an app to target! I really like that you can target the prepositions either expressively or receptively. The pictures that are used in the expressive activity are clear, and my students enjoyed creating sentences to describe the pictures.(Speech Universe)****

The Prepositions Journey app was developed by a certified speech and language pathologist to aid practice with early/common prepositions. Children will have fun practicing prepositions with three animals who appear in three different colorful, animated scenes: camping, island, and city.

The Prepositions Journey app includes:

 Receptive tasks: Children identify animals in different locations on the scene, for example,  Show me the bunny in the basket. 

 Expressive tasks: Children verbally respond to  where  questions, for example,  Where is the bunny? 

Prepositions covered by this app include: 

In, on , under, next to,  in front of, behind, in the back, between, above, below, beside, in the middle, outside, out, over, near, far, on the side, on the left, on the right";1

 DTT is the primary teaching method used in Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) to teach numerous pre-academic and social skills to children with autism. This app can be used to help teach the colors to children with autism, attention deficit disorder (ADD), attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD), or any child who has trouble staying on task. 
 Children using this app will be able to learn the colors and shapes in Chinese, English, French, Norwegian or Spanish. (Note, the startup and config screens and other parts of the app are currently in English only.) 
 Finding the right therapy for a child on the autism spectrum can be overwhelming. Only Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) has years of scientific research proving its effectiveness and is recommended by The National Institute of Mental Health and the Surgeon General. But caregivers quickly learn that well-trained therapists in ABA are expensive and hard to find. During Dr. Brown s forty years of clinical experience as a Licensed Psychologist he has tried to provide low-cost ABA resources for caregivers so they can do their own ABA. ABA and DTT increases your child's likelihood of being mainstreamed, increases happiness, and gives you hope. 
 The DTT Pro App is fully automated and has been tested with children with autism at The Children's Treatment Center. This app is designed to be very simple with no distracting stimuli because children with autism (and other disorders) are easily distracted. This app is not designed to be a general-purpose game, but rather a clinically tested training approach for children with a specific type of learning disability. 
 Please check the app's website for more information about Autism, ABA and DTT.";0

 The Veterinary Sedations application is a practical and straightforward calculator useful for managing sedation/analgesia on stable dogs and cats in everyday clinical situations, such as radiography, orthopedic exams, minor wound cleaning, ear exams/cleaning, eye exams/minor procedures, blood draw on hard-to-handle animals, foxtail probing, and others. This application can be a valuable tool for veterinarians and veterinary technicians working in the very engaged and stressful field of small animal general and critical care practice, or in shelter settings.
 
 The Veterinary Sedations app was designed to provide quick and reliable calculations for either single-drug or combination-of-drugs sedation protocols by using pre-programmed lists of generic drugs, their concentrations, recommended dosage range, and routes. Our database includes the following drugs and combinations - Acepromazine, Buprenorphine, Butorphanol, Dexmedetomidine, Hydromorphone, Methadone, Midazolam, Morphine, Oxymorphone, Dexmedetomidine/Opioid, Acepromazine/Opioid, and Midazolam/Opioid.
 
 For those who are not satisfied with the already pre-programmed options, the Veterinary Sedations software also provides freedom of choice by offering manual entry of all medications, concentrations, and dosages not available on the present drug/concentrations/dosages list.
 
 The Veterinary Sedations app is conveniently divided into two sections, feline and canine, which both have their own calculators. This simple, easily-navigatable design helps the user do their work without getting lost in the UI and easily distinguish between the two species.
 
 The calculator has many unique and practical features and is quite simple in use. It will let you...
 - Create and save patient information logs,
 - Review and update your patient s records/calculations later if needed,
 - Keep all your patient data organized,
 - Search for your patient by name or date,
 - Automatically convert pounds to kilograms for correct calculations,
 - Send text messages with patient information, calculation results, and updates to co-workers,
 - Review some general information for sedative drugs and their combinations,
 - Choose either single-drug or combination-of-drugs sedation protocols,
 - Select medications by generic name from the available list,
 - Choose their concentrations from the available list,
 - Choose their dosages from the list with recommended dosage ranges corresponding with either single-drug or combination sedation protocols,
 - Choose their administration routes from the available list of suggested routes depending on the chosen drug and its dosage,
 - Automatically detect available reversals and calculate them,
 - Use the manual entry option for entering the medications, concentrations, dosages, and routes not available in our database.
 This app was created with the hope to provide practical, quick and reliable help to veterinary professionals in fast-paced environments where there is often no time for manual calculations and scouring through multiple books or more complex apps.";1

About CNA:
----
The Certified Nursing Assistant Examination is divided into two sections, the written examination (WE) and a clinical skills test (CST). You must successfully pass both sections to earn your CNA certification. In most areas you must pass the WE with a 70% or higher. In most areas you also must pass the CST portion with a 70% or higher, and also demonstrate that you can follow each critical step with 100% accuracy.

The written examination will be given on a computer and will be in a multiple-choice format similar to tests you have taken in the past. The clinical skills portion is broken down into  checkpoints  or skills that are preformed in front of a skills evaluator. Your demonstration of the skills does not have to be perfect, but you must show the portion of the step that is deemed critical, which usually involves personal or patient safety or infection control. You will be allowed to correct yourself if you miss a step during a particular skill until you have progressed to the next one

"Providing effective, goal-directed upper limb therapy for young children with cerebral palsy is much more than just  playing with toys . 

In order to acquire new skills and learn, activities or toys must be carefully matched to the ability level and age of each individual child. 

The toys must be challenging but not too hard. They must also be motivating and fun to provide lots of opportunities for repetitive practice and learning. 

Features of the toy need to be carefully considered as each toy will provoke or encourage specific actions. The size, shape and texture will also impact on the difficulty of the task and actions provoked. 

Getting this right can be a difficult task for both therapists and parents. 

Using extensive research and clinical knowledge, the CPtoys  app designed specifically for therapists and families, does the matching for you. 

Along with a child s individual goals, therapists and parents simply enter a few key variables and CPtoys  provides a highly specific, individualised and targeted upper limb therapy program for children with cerebral palsy. 

Enter as many children or goals as you like.";0

"Floater Simulation lets you use your device to show the world your experience with eye floaters. Open the app and tweak the settings to best show your close ones what your every day suffering is like. You can also record a short clip to share on Facebook and the like.

Eye floaters are small moving spots that appear in your field of vision. They may be especially noticeable when you look at something bright, such as white paper or a blue sky.

Floaters are deposits of various size, shape, consistency, refractive index, and motility within the eye's vitreous humour, which is normally transparent. At a young age, the vitreous is transparent, but as one ages, imperfections gradually develop. The common type of floater, which is present in most persons' eyes, is due to degenerative changes of the vitreous humour.

"Sepsis is a serious systemic infection that can quickly lead to circulatory shock, organ failure and death if inappropriately treated. It is also a serious problem in hospitals throughout the US and the world. In 2013, over 1 million people were admitted to US hospitals for sepsis (#1 cause of index admissions) at a total aggregate cost to the US healthcare system of $23.7 billion dollars (#1 most expensive condition), according to an AHRQ report. Over 250,000 people die of sepsis in the US every year, more than from prostate cancer, breast cancer and AIDS combined. Despite its large toll on public health, public awareness of this condition is poor and the quality of treatment is highly variable often due to delayed recognition and treatment.

In sepsis, time is of the essence. Successful treatment hinges on prompt recognition of symptoms, correct antibiotic administration, and hemodynamic stabilization. Lack of appropriate sepsis management knowledge at the bedside leads to delayed symptom recognition, serious complications, medical errors, increased treatment costs, and avoidable morbidity and mortality. For this reason, we created this app to provide busy health professionals with essential management information based on the latest practice guidelines in a format that is easily accessible at the point of care.

The Sepsis app was developed on the ESCAVO mobile publishing platform created specifically for mobile publishing of scientific content. The platform features an intuitive user interface, search, annotation and bookmarking functions, and calculator support. All content is extensively referenced and footnoted where appropriate. This app remains free of charge due to the generous sponsorship of Beckman Coulter.

Clinical topics covered in the Sepsis app include:
- Updated with the latest definitions, diagnostic criteria, and management guidelines including the 2016 Sepsis-3 definitions and the 2016 Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) guidelines
- Epidemiology, risk factors and pathophysiology of sepsis and septic shock
- Common differentials and etiology, guidelines on performing appropriate H&P and workups
- Management of common causes including hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), ventilator-acquired pneumonia (VAP) and intra-abdominal infections
- Sepsis management bundles, early goal-directed therapy, hemodynamic management, adjunctive therapies, mechanical ventilation of sepsis-induced ARDS, and other essential management guidelines from the SSC and the American Thoracic Society (ATS)
- Antibiotic therapy including specific guidelines for the treatment of HAP from ATS and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA)
- Information on the diagnosis and management of pediatric and neonatal sepsis including the management of pediatric fever, important differences from management of sepsis in adults, management of sepsis-induced persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN), empiric antibiotic treatment recommendations for GBS infections, interventions in pediatric septic shock, and other pediatric-specific information
- Important score calculators including the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), quick-SOFA, SIRS, APACHE II, Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score (MODS), the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II, National Early Warning Score (NEWS), the Clinical Pulmonary Infection (CPI) score, the Inferior Vena Cava Collapsibility Index, and others
- Drug administration information for the management of sepsis including antibacterial and antifungal antibiotics, adrenergic and other vasoactive agents, corticosteroids and diuretics

"The ASE Echo AUC App provides a simple, practical approach for physicians to pursue additional professionalism in their daily practice in a more accessible and attainable way. The physician will be motivated to use this app because he/she will be able to have an immediately accessible source to make a quick decision for patient care that is backed up by expert opinion. The physicians will find it easy to use the free AUC App to stratify the patient, by disease and condition, into different treatment scenarios and determine quickly whether an echo should be ordered. They will also be prompted with information on how to best describe these testing limitations to the patient. They will then have more time to focus on the care of the patient and be able to eliminate extra, unneeded or overused testing. This App includes the 98 AUC indications for transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). This App also includes information on the Choosing Wisely campaign and the lists of ""Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question"" that the other participating societies have developed. By including all of the societies' lists this App will educate all physicians utilizing this device about these recommendations, enhance the communication skills of physicians and promote conversations between physicians and patients about utilizing the most appropriate tests and treatments and avoiding care that may provide limited benefit. This App would also foster attitudinal change among physicians and patients. The American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF), in partnership with the American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) and along with key specialty and subspecialty societies, conducted a review of common clinical scenarios where echocardiography is frequently considered. The original document was published in Journal of American Society of Echocardiography (JASE) in 2011 that combined and updated the original transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography appropriateness criteria published in 2007 and the original stress echocardiography appropriateness criteria published in 2008. The indications in this document were developed by a diverse writing group and scored by a separate independent technical panel on a scale of 1 to 9, to designate appropriate use (median 7 to 9), uncertain use (median 4 to 6), and inappropriate use (median 1 to 3). Support for this app was provided by the ABIM Foundation, as part of a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to advance the Choosing Wisely campaign.";1

About: CMC subspecialty certification was introduced in 2005 for specialty certified nurses providing care to acutely/critically ill adult cardiac patients. Nurses interested in this certification may work in such areas as: cardiac care units; combined ICU-CCUs; medical ICUs; telemetry units; progressive care units; heart failure clinics; home care; interventional cardiology; cardiac catheterization labs; or electrophysiology units. CMC  A Registered Service Mark CMC is a registered service mark of AACN Certification Corporation and denotes certification in cardiac medicine nursing as granted by AACN Certification Corporation. Registered nurses who have not achieved CMC certification, whose CMC has lapsed or whose clinical nursing specialty certification has lapsed or is inactive are not authorized to use the CMC credential. CMC Job Analysis Each CMC certification exam is based on a study of practice, also known as a job analysis. The most recent study, completed in 2010, defines the dimensions of acute/critical care practice, identifying what is required of registered nurses practicing in acute/critical care settings and caring for cardiac patients. In the study, acute/critical care nurses across the United States were surveyed to ascertain the significance of the various elements of their practice. Through an extensive review and evaluation process, the knowledge, skills and abilities crucial to cardiac nursing were defined using the AACN Synergy Model for Patient Care as an organizing framework focusing on the clinical judgment component exclusively. The CMC certification exam is based on these skills and abilities and the knowledge required to perform them. CMC certification is achieved by those acute/critical care nurses who pass a CMC exam in cardiac medicine. CMC certification denotes to the public those practitioners who possess a distinct and clearly defined body of knowledge called cardiac nursing.";1

You have a deadline looming. However, instead of doing your work, you are fiddling with miscellaneous things like checking email, social media, watching videos, surfing blogs and forums. You know you should be working, but you just dont feel like doing anything. We are all familiar with the procrastination phenomenon. When we procrastinate, we squander away our free time and put off important tasks we should be doing them till its too late. And when it is indeed too late, we panic and wish we got started earlier. The chronic procrastinators I know have spent years of their life looped in this cycle. Delaying, putting off things, slacking, hiding from work, facing work only when its unavoidable, then repeating this loop all over again. Its a bad habit that eats us away and prevents us from achieving amazing results in life.";0

"Introducing the Surrey National Golf Club - Buggy App Covering in excess of 200 acres, Surrey National is a Championship course approaching 7,000 yards from the Championship tees and 6,300 from the daily play tees. Designed by leading golf course architect, David Williams, the course meanders through dramatic rolling countryside, populated by thousands of mature trees which further enhance the appeal of the setting. Carefully positioned bunkers, raised tees, tree lined fairways and two teasingly placed lakes, mean a good test for golfers of all abilities. Although the contours of the site are dramatic, the clever use of these natural assets ensures that the vast majority of the holes are played either level or downhill, with only one real uphill shot  that being a short pitch to the raised green on the 2nd. As befits a championship length status, the course has a number of difficult par 4s the 16th and bunker less 6th being the most difficult  but the most challenging hole is the 3rd, which requires a carry of over 150 yards across water from the championship tee. Surrey National welcomes visitors, corporate days and societies to play its course and enjoy hospitality in its magnificent clubhouse  the perfect place to relax after a hard round of golf and to enjoy first class catering, free Wi-Fi and excellent service in either our spike bar or Fountain Suite, which both provide spectacular views across the lake, fountains and course beyond.

"VISUALIZE YOU Lets face it. Losing weight is tough. Months of calorie counting, denial and exercise and no clear idea of what youll look like after all that hard work. Finally, after years of research with the Cleveland Clinic and the University of Colorado Anschutz Health and Wellness Center, comes the first scientifically accurate, photographic weight change app, Visualize You. Unlike conventional photo manipulations that stretch or pinch images, the Visualize You weight change viewer modifies the volume of your neck and face based upon clinically verified weight change dynamics. The resulting image of the new you is accurate, photorealistic and represents your specific target weight loss goal, whether modest or significant. HOW IT WORKS In three easy steps, the Visualize You app transforms your image to show the dramatic effects of weight loss. Alternately, you can set a heavier target weight to see the negative effects of an unhealthy diet and lifestyle. To get started, simply upload your photo from your library or use your smart phone to take a photo of your current self. Information guides imbedded in the app will help you take the best resulting image. After entering your height, weight, and desired target weight, define and adjust your image using the intuitive touch screen controls. Hit the next button and, voil, the new you will appear on your phone, providing inspiration and motivation to reach your target weight loss goal. You can even save and send the new you image to your support team of family and friends who will encourage you to achieve your desired weight goal. ACHIEVING THE NEW YOU Staying on track with weight loss and achieving your ideal weight is not easy. It involves creating an eating plan that you can live with rather than just another diet. Regular exercise and the consumption of healthy foods can lead to a host of benefits, including increased energy, happiness, health and even a long life. Exercise and diet are pivotal in determining a persons overall health, and making them both a part of your lifestyle can make a dramatic difference in how you look and feel.

"The best way to learn and remember a disease is to view the [Bloody Scary n Real] disease pictures - That is what ""Real Disease"" is all about. [Caution] This app contains disease pictures that you may feel uncomfortable with, but it is just the best way for you to learn eponymous disease. If you are a medical student, a medical provider or a nurse for any length of time, you will come across eponyms. Eponyms are diseases, disorders, procedures or equipment that is named for some person. For example, you will not be asking for a indwelling urinary catheter, you will be asking for a Foley catheter. When a patient went to the operating room for a pancreaticoduodenenectomy, modified or not, it was not called that, it was called a Whipples surgery. If a patient was at doctors and s/he said, your tests have come back, it would be unlikely for her to say you have an inflammatory B-cell lymphoma, rather she would say, you have Hodgkins disease. Eponyms are a longstanding tradition in Western science and medicine. Being awarded an eponym is regarded as an honor: ""Eponymity, not anonymity, is the standard."" The scientific and medical communities regard it as bad form to attempt to eponymise oneself. To discuss something, it must have a name. At a time when medicine lacked tools to investigate underlying causes of many syndromes, the eponym was a convenient way to label a disease. Some diseases are named after the person who first described the conditiontypically by publishing an article in a respected medical journal. Rarely, an eponymous disease is named after a patient, examples being Lou Gehrig's disease, Hartnup disease, and Mortimer's disease. There are at least two eponymous disorders which follow neither of these conventions: Fregoli delusion, and Munchausen syndrome.";0

It is based upon the guidelines on this topic from the Center for Disease Control & Prevention from 2010 (version 1.0 from CDC 2002 guideline). The app contains 4 algorithms each presented as a cascade of clinical decisions as well as in pictorial scheme of the entire decision flowchart. A general discussion of invasive GBS disease of the newborn prevention is also provided. The app addresses such common questions as: which moms need antibiotics in labor? how does one choose between Penicillin, Ampicillin, Cefazolin, Clinda, and Vancomycin? which moms need culture with sensitivity testing ordered on their GBS screening culture? how do I handle preterm labor and preterm premature rupture of membranes (PTL & PPROM)? how do I handle a mom in labor who never got her 35-37 week GBS culture (or the results are not available)? which babies have been treated adequately to prophylax against GBS disease? how do I handle a baby whose mother arrived and delivered too quickly for prophylactic antibiotics to be given? This app is written and intended for practicing clinicians like OB's, midwives, and family physicians; for resident physician trainees; for medical students; and for any others who are involved in pregnancy and labor care such as L&D nurses, clinical educators, etc. As an educator and clinician, I am interested in feedback and I would be grateful for guidance on improving the tool.";1

It is the subjectively unpleasant feelings of dread over anticipated events, such as the feeling of imminent death. Anxiety is not the same as fear, which is a response to a real or perceived immediate threat; whereas anxiety is the expectation of future threat. Anxiety is a feeling of fear, uneasiness, and worry, usually generalized and unfocused as an overreaction to a situation that is only subjectively seen as menacing. It is often accompanied by muscular tension,restlessness, fatigue and problems in concentration. Anxiety can be appropriate, but when experienced regularly the individual may suffer from an anxiety disorder.

People facing anxiety may withdraw from situations which have provoked anxiety in the past. There are various types of anxiety. Existential anxiety can occur when a person faces angst, an existential crisis, or nihilistic feelings. People can also face mathematical anxiety, somatic anxiety, stage fright, or test anxiety. Social anxiety and stranger anxiety are caused when people are apprehensive around strangers or other people in general. Furthermore, anxiety has been linked with physical symptoms such as IBS and can heighten other mental health illnesses such as OCD and panic disorder.

Anxiety can be either a short term ""state"" or a long term ""trait"". Whereas trait anxiety is a worry about future events, close to the concept of neuroticism, anxiety disorders are a group of mental disorders characterized by feelings of anxiety and fear,Anxiety disorders are partly genetic but may also be due to drug use, including alcohol, caffeine, and benzodiazepines (which are often prescribed to treat anxiety), as well as withdrawal from drugs of abuse. They often occur with other mental disorders, particularly bipolar disorder, eating disorders, major depressive disorder, or certain personality disorders.";1

GolfXion detects that you are about to start your golf swing when your head remains sufficiently still, which automatically starts the head movement detection mode. After this GolfXion will play an audio alert when your head moves. GolfXion will make a video recording of the entire session between the auto-start and the head movement, and this video will be automatically played. GolfXion will then automatically go back to detecting the start of your golf swing. GolfXion will continue to repeat this entire cycle until you exit the detection mode. GolfXion gives you instant feedback on head movement in order to improve the effectiveness of your time at the driving range.In order for GolfXion to detect head movements, your iPhone and iPad must be mounted on a stand as a constant frame of reference is required.

Please check the technical specification for your Apple device and look for Face Detection in video mode before purchase.BackgroundDid you know that all good golf swings have one thing in common? You need to keep your head still. It's no secret that you have to keep your head still in order to maintain good golf posture. It is so important that it applies to swings with your drivers, fairway woods, irons and putting. Good posture will improve your putting too. Most golf swing flaws are caused by moving your head while taking your golf swing. Golf coaches constantly correct this flaw.Keeping your head still is an important fundamental that you need to have someone constantly check for your while you practice. Usually that would be your golf coach. Unfortunately, muscle memory takes around 1,000 hours of practice to ingrain which is why golf professionals are always playing golf and working on their golf swing. So for 1,000 hours of golf coaching time that adds up to be quite a big sum of money.GolfXion uses Apple's Face Detection video hardware acceleration to detect your head movement. It is really simple to use as there are no buttons to press before taking a swing, GolfXion uses the front facing camera to automatically detects when you head is still and gives you an audio alert when your head moves. GolfXion automatically replays the video of your recent golf swing.NOTICE: Tripods or stands to hold your iPhone and iPad are NOT included.

We make it happen!  Contact us:  company@cloudninedevelopment.comWe Build Doctor App or Your Practice App in DaysCloud Nine Development, LLCSmartphones and Web ApplicationsShould I have an App?Are Apps the next Web?  Undoubtedly the answer is Yes. You could and should be the first in your specialty in your area to have an App for your patients and referring physicians.Your Doctor App could be your personalized iPhone application that could be downloaded by your patients from iTunes.com for Free.  They will be able to find you on the iTunes App store by the name you choose (e.g. your name or practice name).  Doctor App has various features from office hours, GPS enabled directions to office locations, contact information to patient education material.  Doctor App could inform your patients about current events and services offered at your practice.  Patients could contact your office for medical records, medication refills, or ask a technician a question right from your application on their phone.  Patients or your referring physicians could request an appointment with you right from the phone through the Doctor App.  By uploading relevant patient education material, a specialist could have their referring doctors use your application for patient education material and then refer patients to you. Here are some of the reasons why a Doctor App would be beneficial compared to a website:User Interface customized to mobile phones and superior to web layout.Ability of user/patients/public to have improved, increased access to their physicians.Increased ability of the physician to reach out to their patients using a current news type function that will update each users application in real time.Potential to reduce costs and save time.  Users can contact/make requests of clinic/hospital staff without a phone call or in person contact.Easy accessibility to physicians offices through GPS enabled map functions on the smartphoneAbility of users to be able to have immediate access to a phone directory and synced callingPatients do not need to remember doctors or nurses names to navigate web and websitePersonalized patient education material that can we emailed or hosted on the application, with similarly personalized patient education videos. The videos can be present on the app and referring physicians can have the patient look at it before they come to see the specialist.We believe Doctor App has the potential to improve practice marketing and branding, patient education and communication, and personal and practice efficiency.

This app helps children learn social rules and behaviors through stories. The Social Norms app is ideal for parents, educators, and speech language pathologists as it allows full customization. The users have the ability to add their own photos, text, and audio recordings to create individualized stories that teach specific skills that the child with autism spectrum disorder may have difficulty learning or understanding. The Social Norms app includes over 50 stories with clear graphics in the following categories:11 Manners Stories:  Saying Thank You, Excuse Me, I Am Sorry,  Saying Hi , Using the Inside Voice, Sharing with Friends, Asking for Help, Waiting for My Turn to Talk, Personal Space , Picking the Nose, Passing Gas15 Hygiene and Health Stories: Washing Hands, Brushing Teeth, Washing Hair, Brushing Hair, Taking a Bath, Showering,  Getting Dressed, Trimming the Nails,  Using Hand Lotion, Putting Sunscreen, Using the Toilet, Headache, Stomachache, Runny Nose, Eating HealthyThree Safety Stories: Crossing the Street, Bike Safety, Seat Belts Six Home Stories: Going to Bed, Cleaning Up Toys, Doing Homework, Helping Mom and Dad, Staying in the Chair During MealtimeEight School Stories: Asking Someone to Play with Me, Waiting in the Hall, Answering in the Classroom, Being Bullied, Being Teased, Recess, Fire Drill, Following Directions in the ClassroomFive Community Stories: Going to the Dentist, Going to the Doctor, Going to the Hairdresser, Going to the Restaurant, Going ShoppingFive Behavior Stories: Biting Others, Pushing Others, Pulling Others Hair, Hitting the Head on the Wall, Running AwayAlthough research is still needed in the area of teaching social skills to children with autism spectrum disorders through stories, a number of studies have concluded that using stories to teach particular social behaviors or skills are in fact successful and children may benefit from this type of intervention. Furthermore, evidence indicates that incorporating visual aids (e.g., visual activity schedules) has positive findings, suggesting that visual aids can be effective for teaching social skills and interactions (Reichow & Volkmar, 2010, p 161).The National Standards Project (National Autism Center, 2010) also supports teaching social skills through stories as an established treatment for children with autism spectrum disorder for children ages six to 14, with evidence-based findings.
