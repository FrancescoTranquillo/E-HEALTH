If your head shifts during a golf swing many things can go wrong! GolfXion provide instant feedback and video review so that you can be a better ball striker. Video Demo of the App (Highly recommend that you view this before using the app) http://youtu.be/otA4Eox94uMNext version update will support iOS 8 onlyGolfXion uses the front facing camera of iPhone and iPad to notify you when your head has moved. GolfXion detects that you are about to start your golf swing when your head remains sufficiently still, which automatically starts the head movement detection mode. After this GolfXion will play an audio alert when your head moves. GolfXion will make a video recording of the entire session between the auto-start and the head movement, and this video will be automatically played. GolfXion will then automatically go back to detecting the start of your golf swing. GolfXion will continue to repeat this entire cycle until you exit the detection mode. GolfXion gives you instant feedback on head movement in order to improve the effectiveness of your time at the driving range.In order for GolfXion to detect head movements, your iPhone and iPad must be mounted on a stand as a constant frame of reference is required. Please visit http://www.golfXion.com/ for suggested stands. There must be sufficient space between the golfer and the stand holding your Apple device.

Please check the technical specification for your Apple device and look for Face Detection in video mode before purchase.BackgroundDid you know that all good golf swings have one thing in common? You need to keep your head still. It's no secret that you have to keep your head still in order to maintain good golf posture. It is so important that it applies to swings with your drivers, fairway woods, irons and putting. Good posture will improve your putting too. Most golf swing flaws are caused by moving your head while taking your golf swing. Golf coaches constantly correct this flaw.Keeping your head still is an important fundamental that you need to have someone constantly check for your while you practice. Usually that would be your golf coach. Unfortunately, muscle memory takes around 1,000 hours of practice to ingrain which is why golf professionals are always playing golf and working on their golf swing. So for 1,000 hours of golf coaching time that adds up to be quite a big sum of money.GolfXion uses Apple's Face Detection video hardware acceleration to detect your head movement. It is really simple to use as there are no buttons to press before taking a swing, GolfXion uses the front facing camera to automatically detects when you head is still and gives you an audio alert when your head moves. GolfXion automatically replays the video of your recent golf swing.NOTICE: Tripods or stands to hold your iPhone and iPad are NOT included.

We make it happen!  Contact us:  company@cloudninedevelopment.comWe Build Doctor App or Your Practice App in DaysCloud Nine Development, LLCSmartphones and Web ApplicationsShould I have an App?Are Apps the next Web?  Undoubtedly the answer is Yes. You could and should be the first in your specialty in your area to have an App for your patients and referring physicians.Your Doctor App could be your personalized iPhone application that could be downloaded by your patients from iTunes.com for Free.  They will be able to find you on the iTunes App store by the name you choose (e.g. your name or practice name).  Doctor App has various features from office hours, GPS enabled directions to office locations, contact information to patient education material.  Doctor App could inform your patients about current events and services offered at your practice.  Patients could contact your office for medical records, medication refills, or ask a technician a question right from your application on their phone.  Patients or your referring physicians could request an appointment with you right from the phone through the Doctor App.  By uploading relevant patient education material, a specialist could have their referring doctors use your application for patient education material and then refer patients to you. Here are some of the reasons why a Doctor App would be beneficial compared to a website:User Interface customized to mobile phones and superior to web layout.Ability of user/patients/public to have improved, increased access to their physicians.Increased ability of the physician to reach out to their patients using a current news type function that will update each users application in real time.Potential to reduce costs and save time.  Users can contact/make requests of clinic/hospital staff without a phone call or in person contact.Easy accessibility to physicians offices through GPS enabled map functions on the smartphoneAbility of users to be able to have immediate access to a phone directory and synced callingPatients do not need to remember doctors or nurses names to navigate web and websitePersonalized patient education material that can we emailed or hosted on the application, with similarly personalized patient education videos. The videos can be present on the app and referring physicians can have the patient look at it before they come to see the specialist.We believe Doctor App has the potential to improve practice marketing and branding, patient education and communication, and personal and practice efficiency. Cloud Nine Development, LLC (www.cloudninedevelopment.com) is a company managed by physicians and they have developed the Doctor App.  Our first product is the Eye Handbook (www.eyehandbook.com), an iPhone application available on Apples iTunes store (www.iTunes.com).
