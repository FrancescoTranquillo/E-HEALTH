You will be asked a series of questions that will lead you to the most probable diagnosis.  This app also contains over 80 photos and charts to help you in your diagnosis. No internet connection needed to view the full app. It is all ready for super quick image and information retrieval. There are also 50 interactive cases to solve. Each case starts with a clinical and dermoscopic image and ends with a labelled dermoscopic image pointing out critical structures.This app is based on the 2 step algorithm with the first step involving the determination of whether the lesion is a melanocytic. Melanocytic lesions will be divided into nevi or lesions with varying levels of suspicion for melanoma based on melanoma specific patterns and common nevi patterns. Non-melanocytic lesions will be analyzed to determine if they are suspicious for basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma. Common benign lesions such as dermatofibroma, seborrheic keratoses and hemangiomas will be positively identified to avoid unnecessary biopsies. This app will increase your ability to detect skin cancers with greater accuracy thereby decreasing unnecessary biopsies and missing less early melanomas and nonmelanoma skin cancers.Check out www.usatinemedia.com to learn more and watch a video demo of this app narrated by Dr. Richard P.
