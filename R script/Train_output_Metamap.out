Each member of your team can easily select the style, color and size they prefer all within the guidelines of your approved uniform program. The Fitting Edge can accommodate the needs of small groups to multiple departments and cost centers within large institutions. Once your fitting event is created the application allows each member of your team to sign in with their own login and select their size and style preferences. Their selection is confirmed by email and can be updated until you select to close your fitting. All uniform requirements are then uploaded to SmartScrubs order fulfillment system for delivery.

Pairing the AURiS app with the AURiS stethoscope makes it ideal for in-situ training.  The simplicity of AURiS provides facilitators with a great tool for training and learners an incredibly realistic platform to learn from. AURiS allows simulation and scenario based education to be delivered quickly, easily and intuitively.AURiS can be used on a manikin and it can be used with standardised patients. Using innovative sensor technology, the student only hears sounds when the AURiS stethoscope is on the patient.

Processing text_000N_56034.tx.1: "Cirrius Wireless Enterprise Platform (CWEP) is a software application used to monitor sales force operations and enable them to prepare for doctor calls, detail products to doctors and report activities on their mobile devices from the field anytime anywhere. This Platform empowers the rep with information on fingertips before, during and after the doctor call. It enables the rep to report call by call by using his waiting time in the clinic. Managers can access real-time data to take informed tactical and strategic decisions.The new version includes the correction in the link from where the data for every module is to be downloaded.Initially user will be presented with the configuration screen, on hitting the configure button, an Http request is made to our server for authentication of the user. Then user gets an alert that it will take 30 - 45 minutes to configure and on clicking OK, the data downloading will begin for all modules.Once the user configures successfully, he will be allowed to login and then he will have access to the various modules of the app.Note:Phyzii Mobile enables medical reps to digitally detail medical content to physicians and manage all other activities to improve effectiveness and productivity."

Processing text_000N_39348.tx.1: "Ensure you know the status of your loved one during a surgical experience at Beloit Health System hospitals. The Beloit Patient Trak (pTrak) is an application that allows family and friends to follow their loved ones surgical progress, from registration to recovery. Instead of being tied to a surgery waiting room for hours or being limited to the hospital facility by the geographic reach of a restaurant-style pager, now loved ones can use their mobile phones to receive notifications when the patient has moved through various stages of the surgical process, and, most importantly, they can be sure to be on site when the patient has recovered and can have visitors. Even family and friends who are out of state can follow the patients physical journey. This technology is available at select hospitals in Beloit Health System.-Real-time Alerts: Alerts are real-time messages sent to whomever the patient chooses throughout the surgical journey.-Freedom of movement: Distance is not an obstacle; this app eliminates the problem of being tied to a surgery waiting room or to a hospital area or even the hospital campus or town.-Reassurance: Alerts keep loved ones apprised of the patients journey.

Processing text_000N_37753.tx.1: "****I really liked this app. With lots of stories already pre-made it saves me a lot of time and means that I can access stories for my kids right away.(Maureen, M.S.CCC-SLP)****The Social Norms app was created by a certified speech and language pathologist for children with autism spectrum disorder. This app helps children learn social rules and behaviors through stories. The Social Norms app is ideal for parents, educators, and speech language pathologists as it allows full customization. The users have the ability to add their own photos, text, and audio recordings to create individualized stories that teach specific skills that the child with autism spectrum disorder may have difficulty learning or understanding. The Social Norms app includes over 50 stories with clear graphics in the following categories:11 Manners Stories:  Saying Thank You, Excuse Me, I Am Sorry,  Saying Hi , Using the Inside Voice, Sharing with Friends, Asking for Help, Waiting for My Turn to Talk, Personal Space , Picking the Nose, Passing Gas15 Hygiene and Health Stories: Washing Hands, Brushing Teeth, Washing Hair, Brushing Hair, Taking a Bath, Showering,  Getting Dressed, Trimming the Nails,  Using Hand Lotion, Putting Sunscreen, Using the Toilet, Headache, Stomachache, Runny Nose, Eating HealthyThree Safety Stories: Crossing the Street, Bike Safety, Seat Belts Six Home Stories: Going to Bed, Cleaning Up Toys, Doing Homework, Helping Mom and Dad, Staying in the Chair During MealtimeEight School Stories: Asking Someone to Play with Me, Waiting in the Hall, Answering in the Classroom, Being Bullied, Being Teased, Recess, Fire Drill, Following Directions in the ClassroomFive Community Stories: Going to the Dentist, Going to the Doctor, Going to the Hairdresser, Going to the Restaurant, Going ShoppingFive Behavior Stories: Biting Others, Pushing Others, Pulling Others Hair, Hitting the Head on the Wall, Running AwayAlthough research is still needed in the area of teaching social skills to children with autism spectrum disorders through stories, a number of studies have concluded that using stories to teach particular social behaviors or skills are in fact successful and children may benefit from this type of intervention.
