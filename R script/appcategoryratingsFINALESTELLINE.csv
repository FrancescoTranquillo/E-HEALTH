Chakras are energy centers located through your physical body; the most important ones are 7, and they influence your life flow.In order to live a balanced life, you must maintain your Chakras in constant balance. When one of them is closed, the others will compensate by opening up more and this will create unbalance in your body, as well as unbalance in your spirit.How to Balance your Chakras?Each Chakra is associated with different colors and different sounds. Certain stones can tune your Chakras and allow energy to flow through them.The same can be done with certain wave frequencies. Chakra Meditation was devised and studied to help you tune your Chakras through meditation. Just tap once the buttons and a soft tune related to that Chakra will start. Tap again to stop it.We put a lot of passion in creating this app, and decided to make it FREE so that everyone can enjoy it and use it to improve their spiritual life.For a better experience and to truly enjoy the high quality of the music, we recommend using headphones instead of speakers.*Chakra Meditation Includes*- 7 HIGH QUALITY tunes, specifically created for each of the 7 most important Chakras- A detailed information page on each of the Chakras, useful to remind what energy centers of the body they influence, their location and their name.- The screen will change color once you select a specific Chakra, aiding you in your meditation.- High definition background, created for iPad Retina display but available on all Apple devices.- For a brief overview of how to use the App, just tap the Question button on the lower right side of the screen for help.Here are some reviews for Chakra Meditation Balancing:••••• This app has literally and figuratively assisted in changing my perspective on life!
