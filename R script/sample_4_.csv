Take control of your PAD program & improve knowledge on where these lifesaving devices are located (or build your local registry) using HeartSafe. HeartSafe makes every second count in the fight against Sudden Cardiac Arrest (SCA). SCA is the leading cause of death in the US, according to the Institute of Medicine and it is a worldwide problem. The cardiac chain of survival; calling 911, starting CPR and using an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) within 3 to 5 minutes of collapse are critical.HeartSafe is the most current and comprehensive AED location notification registry of AEDs for PAD programs. HeartSafe allows adding and placing (registering) an AED location on a map by GPS coordinates (Place It) so that users of this application can find nearby public or their own privately placed nearby AEDs. HeartSafe fills a critical information gap and can save valuable minutes of time from collapse to time of shock using the AED, making minutes matter while waiting for EMS arrival which improves survival rates.HeartSafe accumulates data on program champions doing AED servicing or registrations. HeartSafe also tracks and alerts AED owners on their internal CPR/AED training and AED accessory expirations. The built in Call 911 button to help facilitate 911 assistance with an autodial feature to ensure early EMS arrival and decrease delays in calling 911.HeartSafe is an important tool that brings dispatch centers, AED dealers, AED owners, AED users (bystanders), and SCA victims together. The AEDs located and registered are cleared by the local PAD program administrator and when approved, become visible on a map to the appropriate app users (public or private users have different views of AEDs; private can see their PLUS any public AEDs). If an AED dealer is servicing the unit, they are alerted and ensured continued servicing and maintenance on the unit and included in any AED notifications. If an AED is out of service or out of compliance, alerts are sent, and can't be seen on the map/registry for HeartSafe app users and dispatch views until it is back into readiness and in compliance.HeartSafe is an important lifesaving tool for bystanders, company volunteers trained in CPR, coaches, athletic trainers, firefighters, EMTs or paramedics, police, doctors, and nurses  enabling them to more easily find an AED (one of their own AEDs placed at an organization/private company or a nearby public AED) close to them when a life threatening cardiac emergency occurs. Private AED owners and organizations with AEDs on site can register (Place It) any devices they own as well and improve the local 911 dispatch knowledge on where the closest AEDs are located at an organization or public area where the 911 caller reports a cardiac CPR-related emergency. 911 dispatch centers can also alert any HeartSafe app users nearby (profile settings allow app user to set desired perimeter for alerts from 0-100 miles away) of a CPR emergency and where the nearest AED is located, allowing one-touch directions, improving AED response times, and enabling early CPR. AED owners and citizens that register AEDs ensure that any AED in the community or local PAD program has proper maintenance and upkeep. HeartSafe includes expiration alerts, records inspections, and ensures AEDs are inspected to American Heart Association (AHA) and HeartSafe program standards. The AED check is a free built-in feature that allows technology to continually ensure maintenance and archive maintenance information, reducing liability.HeartSafe strengthens the chain of survival and improves PAD programs.

EBM Stats Calc let's a clinician do calculations that are hard or impossible to do in one's head.  A clinician can get NNT's (number needed to treat) from rates, percentages, or raw event and patient numbers.  And a clinician can use sensitivity and specificity or likelihood ratios (LR+, LR-) to go from a pretest probability to posttest probability and positive predictive value and negative predictive value.Although these calculators themselves are somewhat novel for apps, the unique tool in this app is for educators.  Students and residents have a hard time understanding how the utility of a test can vary with pretest probability.  Instead of saying it in words and hoping they get it, now you can demonstrate it.  A test might perform well, giving good PPV and NPV, when pretest probability is in a certain range.  But slide that pretest probability up or down and see the diagnostic utility change with the numbers flying right before your eyes.  The tool also shows a student that in many cases, an imprecise estimate of pretest probability doesn't much matter.  Different doctors might judge a clinical case to suggest likelihood of disease (pretest probability) of 40%, 50%, or 60%.  The slider tool shows that the differences may not matter, and the test in mind will render good clarity regardless of differing opinions on pretest probability.The app is written for clinicians, students, residents, and especially educators, in any discipline of medicine.  As a clinician and educator myself, I would be grateful for feedback to make the tool better.";"EBM Stats Calc, Joshua Steinberg, MD, Medical, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"1.1";17;"English";374154837;"Joshua D. steinberg";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/joshua-steinberg-md/id374154837?mt=8";0;NA;0,906;"2018-01-22";"2018-01-04";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;"2018-10-25"
