"Updated for the future: 64-bit native code. \"A Best Science App (highest rating: Excellent)--Great interface, easy navigation\" Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology News Dec 2013** NO ADS **Do you (or your students, if you're a teacher) know why the AiDS-causing virus, HIV, is called a retrovirus and how it actually uses the material and machinery of the \"host\" cell it has invaded to reproduce itself? Do you (or they) have a firm idea what the terms \"minus strand, PBS, PPT, and LTR\" mean? What does tRNA have to do with retroviruses, anyway? The simulations of OnScreen Retrovirus use the 3D nucleic acid models of our highly regarded DNA apps to make memorable the crucial steps by which the reverse transcriptase enzyme complex of a retrovirus uses nucleotide building blocks of the host cell to copy the viral genome, initially on a single strand of RNA, to a newly constructed double-stranded DNA molecule, ready to be inserted into the host's DNA as a source of new copies of the virus.The goal of this app is to convey the conceptual details of the viral genome transfer from RNA to DNA without requiring of the user a deep prior knowledge of molecular biology. Since a ball-and-stick model of nucleic acids is used for the simulations, this is not done at the level of atomic detail, but the simulations are never in conflict with the biochemistry.Unlike other simulations you might see on the internet, this app shows how the DNA synthesis is at every stage a three-dimensional double-helix-forming process and that it involves several steps, which include the separation of strands and the relative movement of the strands to allow annealing to each other at complementary sections, the steps being dependent on three separate activities of the reverse transcriptase complex: RNA-dependent DNA synthesis, RNA degradation, and DNA-dependent DNA synthesis. The role of the virus's nucleocapsid protein as enhancer of the annealing of strands is also indicated.Since retrotransposons--which we all have in our DNA!--make use the very same steps to make new copies of their DNA through an intermediate RNA strand before inserting it at another spot in the cell's DNA, the app serves as a simulation of how they work as well. Background material on viruses, nucleic acids, and enzymes, as well as commentary on each new step in the process of copying the single strand of RNA into a double-stranded DNA molecule are at your fingertips in the app. You can run the simulations with automatic pauses at key steps for convenience in reading of the commentary for the steps or straight through, pausing only when desired.Whether for first-time learning, clarification of ideas previously encountered, or review, OnScreen Retrovirus is now at your service."

"Over ONE MILLION users are using ECG Cases to learn and sharpen electrocardiography knowledge and skills! They are medical students and teachers, primary healthcare providers, physicians, practitioners, and nurses. Join them today to get your ECG knowledge refresh.Medical App Editor's Review:Here is a beautiful app with rich collection of real 12-lead ECG cases you can use to develop your interpretation skills. Each case is identified with a brief description (e.g., \"Male 73 y/o, HR 158; Ectopic arrhythmia - atrial tachycardia with intraventricular aberrant conduction...\"). Select a case and you can choose either Play mode, which shows you the ECG telemetry as you'd see it on a monitor in real time, with beeps for heartbeats, or Read mode, which gives you the printed ECG tracing to interpret. You can choose cases by category or search for them by name. You can also bookmark cases and return to them later.For students and practitioners who wish to strengthen their ECG-reading capabilities, this app would seem justified, because ECG Cases gives you an effective way to immerse yourself in a wide range of ECG patterns and interact with them as if these were your own patients.Customer Reviews:1. Excellent for review of multiple rhythms. You'll need to come with your basic understanding of EKG interpretation but the app is great for a challenge.2. Great variety of cases and interpretation help break down the rhythms. Perfect way for students to study3. It is a great learning tool. I use this app for school and it helps out a lot for understanding how to read them and what to look for.4. Excellent learning tool for newbies and as ongoing refresher for others. Great examples5. Very detailed app for learning ECGs, all my staff has this app for continued learning.6. As a medic student this app is amazing. It's helped me a lot more than I could have hoped for.7. I have been a paramedic for 15 yrs, I found this app to be an excellent tool for refreshing and expanding my knowledge8. Great app. Most of strips are above my skill level a a paramedic but still fun to play and learn. Very well rendered. Would be nice if there was a \"basic\" version of this for paramedics and nurses. Also a brief explanation of why a strip is interpreted the way it is would be helpful.\"I'm reviewing the app with my father who happens to be a specialist in internal medicine, and we're astonished with this app capabilities in helping students like myself understand EKG waves. It's not easy but with the help of this app EKG makes more sense to me.\"\"This is a great App that exemplifies and provides easy training for medical professionals.
