Along with sweat glands, the skin contains oil glands. The oil your skin releases helps to keep your skin from drying out and your hair from becoming brittle.The heart : is another vital organ. The heart's job is to pump oxygenated blood throughout your body and receive deoxygenated blood back in return. Without your heart, your other organs would not receive oxygen or have carbon dioxide removed. In an average lifetime, the heart beats more than 2.5 million times!picture of organs in human body.The kidneys : are located under the rib-cage in your lower back.

Did you know that a healthy person is able to live with only kidney?.The liver : is located in the upper abdomen, slightly more to the left side. The main job of the liver is to produce bile, which it sends to the stomach for digestion. The liver also filters out toxins and regulates blood sugar. Blood sugar is regulated because the liver converts sugars and stores them, releasing them when more sugar is needed in the blood. The liver is also in charge of releasing cholesterol, breaking down fats, and producing blood proteins. It is the largest internal organ!.The pancreas : is located in the abdomen, behind the stomach. The job of the pancreas is to produce enzymes necessary for digestion and send them to the stomach. The pancreas also regulates blood sugar and does this through its process of creating insulin. The pancreas also creates glucagon which has the opposite effect of insulin and also helps to maintain blood sugar levels.The stomach : receives food from the esophagus and sends it into the small intestine. The stomach's role in digestion is to break down food and mix it with digestive juices or enzymes.The lungs : are located in your chest and are protected by your rib cage. The lungs take in oxygen which goes into the blood through the heart, and expels carbon dioxide as the heart receives oxygenated blood.With this application you will find about internal organs of human body and their functions with human body organs picture for you now.";"Anatomy Human Body Organs, Hasyim Mulyono, Health & Fitness, Reference, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"1.15";12;"English";1137411855;"Hasyim Mulyono";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/hasyim-mulyono/id1137411855?mt=8";0;"0";45,8;"2017-05-26";"2016-09-23";0;0;0;0;0;0;0;"2018-10-25";1;0;"Dermatology";"Cardiology";"Nutrition";0;0;0;1;0,832467532467532;0;0,319896103896104
