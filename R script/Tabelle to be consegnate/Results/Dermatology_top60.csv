USE YOUR REGIMEN FOR LAYERING ADVICEFollow the recommended layering order, along with advice for when and how to use each of The Ordinary products. KEEP TRACK OF USAGE TO AVOID CONFLICTSEach morning and evening, check each product off your list to keep track of which treatments you have used. This will allow the app to prevent any conflicts by showing you which products should be avoided. ALTERNATING TREATMENTSWhen switching between products on different days (either due to conflicts, weekly limits or just to avoid overloading), you can see the last six days of usage (most recent on the right) to help decide which to use next. RATE YOUR SKINAny time you notice your skin is looking particularly good or bad, you can make a note of it by pressing on the face icon next to the morning or evening routine.**************************Advanced Customization************************** ADD CUSTOM PRODUCTSYou can add custom skincare products from other brands by selecting the option in the top-right menu in the Regimen section. RE-ORDER YOUR REGIMENIf you don't wish to follow the recommended layering order, you can choose to re-order the products to fully customize your routine by selecting the option from the top right menu of the Regimen section. USE CONFLICTING PRODUCTSWhen we recommend not using a product due to conflicts with other products or because you've reached the usage limit, you can choose to ignore the warning and use it anyway. You will then have the option to permanently ignore conflicts on that specific product. CHANGE TIME OF DAYThere are some products which can be used AM and/or PM but one is recommended more than the other. From your regimen, select a product to see the option to change the time of day. OVERRIDE TIMESThere are other products where it is strongly recommended to only use at a specific time of day or only once per day. This can be overriden by selecting a product and pressing the Override button.***********Skin Types***********Unsure of which products to buy? Choose a routine based on your skin type...
