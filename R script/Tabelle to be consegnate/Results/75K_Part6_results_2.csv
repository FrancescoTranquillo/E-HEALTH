The ultimate application for tinnitus sufferers. Only naturally produced sounds of musical instruments and sounds of Mother Nature - no synthesizers! Developed by an expert software engineer in the field of frequency analysis and a leading music psychologist, music therapist and hearing therapist with more than 20 years experience in the treatment of tinnitus sufferers. Used very successfully in the treatment of tinnitus. Tinnitus Help contains a broad range of functions but operating it is childs play: 1. Accurate analysis of your tinnitus 2. Tinnitus masker and noiser 3. Reprogramming your auditory cortex 4. Stimulating your central auditory perception Helping you to 5. defocus 6. habituate 7. relax 8. fall asleep This is how it works: Tinnitus Help utilizes the fact that the same brain activities that enable us to perceive auditory stimuli, i.e. real sounds, also cause the perception of the tinnitus sound. Thus Tinnitus Help is able to intervene in central auditory processes. Tinnitus Help forms an image of your individual tinnitus frequency (up to 20.000 Hz) and offers you the option to mix this frequency with pleasant sounds or music. This means that Tinnitus Help can assist you to change the way you perceive your tinnitus sound by letting it gradually fade into the background. Regular listening to your individual Tinnitus Help setting will enable you to learn how to increasingly fade out the sound in your ear and eventually ignore it. Experts call this habituation. Step one: Establish your individual tinnitus frequency by using the slide switch. It does not matter if it is the left or the right ear that is affected or both. Are you suffering from tinnitus sounds that rise and fall? Or cricket like sounds? Or red noise? You can mix all additional sounds to your tinnitus frequency, thereby optimizing your tinnitus profile. Step two: Choose a pleasing sound and add it to your tinnitus profile. Using this combination, you will feel your tinnitus gradually fading into the background. What you are experiencing is the effect of defocusing. You have now created your own individual, perfect tinnitus masker, which you can call up any time anywhere. Set the time on how long you want your program to run for and use your tinnitus setting as masker to help you relax and to fall asleep. Step three: Influence the activity of your auditory cortex. The area in which your tinnitus frequency is located will be especially active and, depending on how frequently and how intensely you pay attention to your tinnitus, this area will spread like an ink stain on a piece of blotting paper. However, you can restrict the growth of this area by adding one of the pieces of music on offer to your setting. The music has been especially written for tinnitus sufferers. All pieces of music are produced naturally on musical instruments; no synthesizers are used. The association I am hearing pleasing sounds or music will at first be stored in the hippocampus, our memory centre. If the experience is repeated by using tinnitus help, the hippocampus works like a trainer for your cerebral cortex. It will repeatedly offer the stored information to the cerebral cortex, resulting in the new input being learnt and new programs etched into the auditory cortex. Regularly recurring musical structures act like a massage on certain areas of the brain. Where tinnitus is present, this will be experienced as a negative effect. However, you can turn this to your advantage by calling up your very own personalised music in your head. Retrieve it whenever you need it, influence your perception processes and learn to set up the reprogramming of your central auditory pathway. In general the tinnitus has the same frequency as the peak in your hearing loss.

During the latter, the patient listens to an artificially generated sound as similar as possible to the one his ear perceives for 4 to 6 hours a day. This sound masking mitigates the perception of sound, re-establishing a new threshold to auditory experiences.If the audio treatment is continued for 6 weeks straight, the symptoms of tinnitus are lessened considerably, and even appear to disappear completely.How to use this appTinnitus Relief Sound Masking System is avery modern system to find your tinnitus and provide a remedy.

Originally released in 1999 as Tinnitus Tamer on the Mackintosh, and in 2012 on the iPad. The Tinnitus Tamer XS provides a much-simplified user interface for the same treatment techniques, which evolved from the original Tinnitus Tamer.     It is not commonly known that the acoustic nerve not only transmits electrical data from the inner ear to the brain stem, but also transmits information from the brain stem back to the inner ear *. The normal function of this negative feedback is to reduce the translation of acoustical background noise and loud signals into electrical signal by the inner ear. Any wave system with negative feedback can, under certain conditions, produce positive feedback. When this happens in the hearing process, it is referred to as Tinnitus.     The alternating tone and silence sequences produced by the Tinnitus Tamer affect the brain stem in a way to change the positive feedback back into negative feedback. Thus, the Tinnitus Tamer XS uses the resources of your own body to take care of the Tinnitus in a natural way.* Dr. Terry L. Levin      In some cases, the Tinnitus will rapidly disappear, but more likely, it will improve in stages: First, during a training session. Next, for a short period after a training session has ended. Gradually, the time of relief after a training session will increase. Eventually, the Tinnitus will be reduced to a low level that is of little bother. Many Tinnitus sufferers will find that the Tinnitus will be eliminated.

This is true for disorders characterized by compulsivity, impulsivity, and disturbed attention, but also for psychiatric disorders that involve severe emotional disturbances, such as major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorder and even psychotic disorders. Therefore translational, cross-disorder studies with a life span perspective from early vulnerability to late disease chronicity may enhance our knowledge and treatment possibilities for a very large group of patients representing a serious burden to families and society as a whole.The focus of the TN2-2018 conference is clinically oriented but with a strong background in translational neuroscience and deals in particular with the role of neuroinflammation in the etiology of psychiatric disorders and also on solutions to be found in the field neurostimuation.

The prognostic factors included in the new TNM are: Tumor Grade (G), HER2, Estrogen Receptor (ER) and Progesterone Receptor (PR). Genomic Profiles were also incorporated as a prognostic factor for eligible cases (pT1-T2 N0 M0 HER2- and ER+) in the Pathological Prognostic Stage.The Anatomic Stage is based solely on the anatomic extent of cancer as defined by the T, N, and M categories and should be used for all patients even if prognostic staging is possible.The Clinical Prognostic Stage will be used to assign stage for all patients based on history, physical examination, imaging studies, and relevant biopsies. Clinical Prognostic Stage is determined by cT, cN, c/pM, G, HER2, ER, and PR. Genomic profile information is not included in Clinical Prognostic Stage.The Pathological Prognostic Stage will be used to assign stage for patients who have the surgical resection as the initial treatment of their cancer before any systemic or radiation therapy. It includes all information used for clinical staging plus findings at surgery and pathological findings from surgical resection. Pathological Prognostic Stage is determined by pT, pN, c/pM, G, HER2, ER, and PR. Genomic profile information can be used for the Pathological Prognostic Stage (pT1-T2 N0, HER2- and ER+). Pathological Prognostic Stage does not apply to patients treated with chemotherapy, hormone therapy or radiation prior to surgical resection (neoadjuvant therapy).This App provides the quantification of the category change of the Clinical Prognosis Stage (cPS) and also the Pathological Prognostic Stage (pPS) in relation to the Anatomic Stage (AS) expressed in the Staging Line with the symbol +1, +2, +3 in case of worsening in the Prognostic Staging or -1, -2, -3 in case of improvement in the Prognostic Staging. When no symbol is shown, it is because the AS and cPS or AS and pPS are identical.This App has other function that shows Oncotype DX / Genomic Profile field only in some setting when the genomic test is potentially indicated (pT1-T2 N0, HER2- and ER+).This App is very useful for breast surgeons, surgical oncologists, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, pathologists, radiologists, medical students, scientists, researchers, and all healthcare professionals working in the field of breast oncology.

Its widely known that the drugs and treatments prescribed are not really designed to heal, they are just aimed at the symptoms. Many illnesses are wrongly diagnosed, as some symptoms shown are caused by other issues. This means sometimes people have several medications, when really the root cause needs the treatment, and of course the many symptoms will be dealt with at the same time. Frequency, or sound dates back to the time of Imohtep, some 7000 years ago. He is widely considered to be the father of medicine. He sketched 30 surgical procedures on papyrus, and used a lyre (a type of harp) and a harmonic choir to achieve the desired frequencies to heal. I have worked with energy and frequency for many years now, and have helped many thousands of people heal from various illness be it mental or physical using these methods. It has taken some time to hone various frequency to address different issues we may have. After you have listened to some of the audios in this app you will feel very relaxed, and at ""ease"" the word disease is made up of dis - ease, therefore restoring ease creates balance, or equilibrium. There is a free sample of self-healing in the app, by way of a chakra balance, and cleansing. Also there is an audio for stress and anxiety, which is on offer for only 99 cents! We all suffer from stress at sometime or other, helping to cope with this will not only relieve it, but will make sure that the stress or anxiety that you have will not lead to more serious dis - ease.";"To help, to heal - What we are feeling we are heal, graham elkin, Health & Fitness, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";NA;4;"English";1148315683;"graham elkin";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/graham-elkin/id1148315683?mt=8";0;NA;64,3;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;"2018-10-25";1;0;"MentalHealth&Neurology";"SensorySystemsHealthcare";NA

The first thing you need to do is find the current tempo ratio of your swing. The Tour Tempo Frame Counter App is the easiest and quickest way to do that, because it allows you to view and count sport action video, specifically the golf swing, by advancing the video one frame at a time. Once you have the tempo ratio of your swing, you then can compare it to the tempo ratio of your favorite PGA Tour Pro. To understand why you need the Tour Tempo Frame Counter App, it's important to know what Tour Tempo is:Tour Tempo is the name of the international best selling golf book that explained how amateur golfers could dramatically improve their ball striking  instantly, in most cases  by copying the tempo of the Tour Pros. It outlined the discovery of a specific mathematical ratio regarding the elapsed time of the backswing and the elapsed time of the downswing of the Tour Pros. By using this correct ratio, Tour Tempo allows you to learn how to correctly integrate the Tempo of the Tour Pros into your golf swing  both the Long Game and the Short Game. The Tour Tempo System is simple and easy to learn. All you do is react to three scientifically spaced musical notes. These musical notes alert you to start your takeaway, start your downswing, and then the third note lines you up with impact. Its just that easy. It is used by beginners through Major Championship winners on the PGA Tour, and has been validated by an Independent Scientific Study by the Departments of Physics and Biomechanics at Yale University. Furthermore, the Titleist Performance Institutes 3D research data accumulated from the swings of the Tour Pros also confirms the results of the Yale University study. And they also added that Tour Tempo is the only golf training aid that has been validated by an independent scientific study. ""It will be the best thing that you will ever do for your game.""- Pat Dempsey, 2002 RE/MAX World Long Drive Sr. Champion ""You will get better right away! When you synch your swing to that of the Tour Pros with Tour Tempo, youll get better right now!"" - Dan Rooney, PGA Teaching Professional""No one has ever come up with a way to teach Tempo until now."" - Travel + Leisure Golf In order to improve your tempo, it is helpful to learn what your swing tempo is and have an easy way to track it as you go along. Thats where the Frame Counter App comes in. There are three important points in the swing used to determine tempo  the start of the takeaway, start of your downswing, and then when the clubhead arrives at impact. The Frame Counter App makes it easy to quickly determine your tempo on the range or on the course.(This app does not contain the Tour Tempo Tones - take a look at our Total Game App that contains the Tones If you are interested in learning more about the Tour Tempo Training system.)Find your Tour Tempo now with the Frame Counter app.";"Tour Tempo Frame Counter Golf, Tour Tempo, Sports, Health & Fitness, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"1.3";4;"English";313846745;"John Novosel";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/tour-tempo/id313846745?mt=8";1,99;"$";3,5;"2018-04-18";"2012-03-05";4,4;14;79;0;0;7;14;"2018-10-25";1;0;NA;NA;NA

Almost everyone will experience some form of tinnitus at least once in the lifetime and in most of the cases this sensation disappears within seconds or minutes. However, in approximately 10% of the population the tinnitus persists for more than six months and can remain chronic for the rest of the life.Even in the chronic case, the perception of the tinnitus can vary during the day and between days being sometimes more and sometimes less perceivable. The variation can depend on many factors including environmental noise, the daily activity, stressful life events, time of the day and much more. Many people have a good feeling of their tinnitus variation and can reconstruct it from memory to some extent - but how was the timeline of the variation exactly? Until recently it was not possible to systematically track the tinnitus perception over several weeks.With this research project we want to offer a method to track the individual tinnitus perception with a smart phone application. Using the website in conjunction with your phone you can systematically track the variation of your tinnitus and find out how it is associated with your daily routine and activities. Your answers will also help us learn to more about the daily variation of the tinnitus perception, its causes and effects.About the TeamTrackYourTinnitus was developed by the Tinnitus Research Initiative (TRI) and the Institute for Databases and Information Systems (DBIS) at the University of Ulm.

Note: this app can be used on city streets as well as on hiking trails. Use anywhere you wish to keep track of a new or saved route. A green marker indicates the starting point, and a red marker indicates the end point. Address and geolocation information can be obtained by tapping each marker.You can choose to stop recording anytime and either save the route or discard it. You can then choose to continue recording the same route or reset the app to a new start after saving the trail.Saved HistoryBy browsing the saved routes history, you can see previous hiking routes to retrace the steps.Once a trail is saved to history, you can follow it later by clicking the ""Trace"" button and then the ""Start"" button to follow the original trail route, so you can find exactly where the trail was started and what places are along the way. This helps you avoid getting lost by knowing exactly which path to choose at each intersection.PhotosYou can upload photos that were taken along the route and tag the photo thumbnails on the exact geolocations where the photos were taken. In order for this to work, cameras that are equipped with GPS sensors need to have their location services enabled so that photos will have geolocation tags attached. For standalone cameras that do not have GPS capability,their time settings must be in sync with the phone's settings, but the original photos cannot be modified.ShareClicking the share button enables sharing of trail links via email, messaging, social networks, etc. You can share privately with friends or publicly on www.everytriplan.com to benefit other hikers.Your friends can download a trail to their phones via the shared link  generated by the application. You can also go directly to www.everytriplan.com to browse and search specific trails and download them to your phone locally.DownloadsFirst, you must obtain the download ticket number of the trail you wish to work with. From the trail detail page of the web site www.everytriplan.com, click the download button on the top. The ticket number will be displayed above the map image. In the Trail Meter application, press the ""+"" button under the ""Downloads"" screen. A text input field will appear. Copy and paste or type the ticket number obtained from the above step to proceed with downloading.TraceYou can follow saved history and downloaded trails by clicking the ""Trace"" button from the trail detail screen. This also works well for remote areas where there is no established trail, no cell service, or where no maps would be available on the phone. The original saved or downloaded trail routes could be useful guides and references to explore wilderness areas and to avoid getting lost. Tapping the photo thumbnails displays enlarged photos with exact latitude and longitude coordinates for better viewing.DeleteTo delete any trails that are under History and Downloads, swipe from right to left and select Delete. Another way is to click the Edit button and tap the red circle with a minus sign on the trail you wish to delete. Set Location CoordinatesSet up waypoints by either (1) typing in the latitude/longitude coordinates, or (2) adding the current location while walking. The latter option can save you from typing the latitude/longitude values as the app itself will automatically populate the current location values.

"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/train-of-four/id975809647?mt=8";"Train of Four";975809647;"Medical";"During administration of general anesthesia, neuromuscular blockade is best measured with a train-of-four (TOF) ratio technique, which utilizes a nerve stimulator and a measurement device, such as mechanomyography. During TOF stimulation, the nerve stimulator causes a short burst for four muscle twitches. The force of each twitch is related to the degree of neuromuscular blockade. By dividing 4th to the 1st twitch height, one can assess TOF ratio. The ratio >0.9 is considered as safe for extubation of endotracheal tube and complete reversal from the neuromuscular blockade.  Although nerve stimulators are widely accessible to anesthesiologists, the measuring devices are not. Therefore, instead  of measuring TOF ratio, anesthesiologist generally rely on count of twitches and pharmacological reversal for everyone. This practice has been shown to be problematic.  Data suggest that even mild degrees of residual paralysis (TOF 0.7-0.9) may be associated with significant impairment of respiratory and pharyngeal muscle function. Several studies have demonstrated that many patients continue to arrive in the postanesthesia care unit with TOF ratios <0.9. By combining the built in accelerometer in the iPhone along with the app,  we have developed an alternative way of measuring the TOF ration. Our app development team included an anesthesia resident (RB) and an attending (MP) who, provided the medically relevant content, and a computer programmer (KT) to translate the vision into the computer's language. The next step  will be a validation study of the predictive value of TOF ratio measured by iphone as compared with conventional mechanomyography devices and visual assessment.";"Train of Four, ObjectGraph LLC, Education, Medical, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";NA;4;"English";284700705;"ObjectGraph LLC";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/objectgraph-llc/id284700705?mt=8";0;NA;1,7;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;"2018-10-25";1;0;"EmergencyMedicine";NA;NA

Automatic pulling is such that occurs without the person being aware of the urge to pull prior to engaging in the behavior, and so pulling often occurs without awareness. Focused hair pulling on the other hand, is when there is a clear and distinct irresistible urge to pull, resulting in the person purposefully engaging in the behavior. In both instances, in order to apply skills and strategies to tackle the behavior, it is important for the individual to be aware of when they tend to or are most at risk of pulling. Pulling usually follows a pattern, and by identifying this pattern one can anticipate when the urge is most likely to occur.  One of the strategies used to gain awareness of the behavior is keeping a pulling log. This app allows you to document your pulling urges and episodes. Each time you experience an urge to pull or have a pulling episode, you can add an entry to the journal. After a while of using the app, you will have gathered enough data to start seeing patterns in your behavior: whether you pull at specific times of day, due to certain circumstances, etc. It can be very valuable as a stand-alone journaling tool, however you can expect best results when you use it as part of a therapeutic process with a therapist, preferably CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy).";"TrichStop - Trichotillomania Monitoring App, vanessa webbstock, Medical, Health & Fitness, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"3.0.0";12;"English";1395138936;"vanessa webbstock";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/vanessa-webbstock/id1395138936?mt=8";0;NA;20,6;"2017-02-27";"2017-01-02";4,7;7;86;0;14;0;0;"2018-10-25";1;0;"MentalHealth&Neurology";NA;NA

YOGA SCIENCEYogis of the past employed methods of observation, experimentation, and systematic thought in their exploration of not only the physical and natural but also our own inner world. Furthermore, the science and practice of Yoga has been continuously put to test for thousands of years and it has consistently delivered on the promise. We continue in the same scientific tradition to enhance our modern lives. Weve interpreted the timeless principles of Yoga into modern, actionable techniques. These techniques are what make the Self Intelligence framework upon which all of our products and services are built.THE SCIENCE BEHIND JOURNALINGSuccessful people throughout history have kept journals. There is increasing evidence to support the notion that journaling has a positive impact on physical well-being.  University of Texas at Austin psychologist and researcher James Pennebaker contends that regular journaling strengthens immune cells, called T-lymphocytes. Other research indicates that journaling decreases the symptoms of asthma and rheumatoid arthritis. Pennebaker believes that writing about stressful events helps you come to terms with them, thus reducing the impact of these stressors on your physical health. Journal writing also removes mental blocks and allows you to use all of your brainpower to better understand yourself, others and the world around you.";"Triumph Journal, RCCI Group, Inc., Lifestyle, Health & Fitness, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"1.2 (3)";4;"English";1147740701;"RCCI Group, Incorporated.";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/rcci-group-inc/id1147740701?mt=8";0;NA;20,1;"2018-10-16";"2018-09-27";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;"2018-10-25";1;0;"Cardiology";"GinecologyAndObstetrics";"MentalHealth&Neurology"

Tropical Gastroenterology was initially advanced as a forum of sorts, to discuss relevant issues and make discoveries in the fore-mentioned fields. It was typically felt that gastroenterological diseases were the most common medical problems bothering the populations of developing countries and that the spectrum of diseases seen was considerably different from those seen in the West, which thus received lesser emphasis there. The Editorial team then, determined to sculpture practical and theoretical knowledge in this field through publishing and making widely available original research. We quote a line from the editorial of our first issue, Why Tropical Gastroenterology? We were a little unhappy at paying half our months salary for journal subscriptions which contained articles entitled, Plasma alpha-Amino-gamma-butyric acid to leucine ratio: non-specificity as a marker for alcoholism. May we not read articles that tell us how to manage a duodenal ulcer patient who cannot afford antacids leave alone cimetidine? At its inception funds were restricted and number of articles wanting. However there was never a dearth of journal staff, volunteer workers or doctors across various fields that faithfully devoted their time and ideas towards helping Tropical Gastroenterology grow, and still continue to do so. During the nascent years the Digestive Diseases Foundation provided financial support and now Tropical Gastroenterology is entirely funded through advertising itself. In 1988, Professor Nundy left the journal and Professor Bhupinder Singh Anand took his place; in 1991 Professor Subrat Acharya took over the editorship along with Dr Girish Pandey; under their instruction the journal grew steadily. After Dr Girish Pandey withdrew, Dr Vineet Ahuja was included in the Editorial Board in 2007.";"Tropical Gastroenterology, Naveen Jha, Medical, Education, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"1.2";4;"English";1240885481;"Naveen Jha";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/naveen-jha/id1240885481?mt=8";0;NA;21,4;"2018-05-27";"2018-05-04";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;"2018-10-25";1;0;"Gastroenterology";NA;NA

Opportunity has presented itself! www.gottru.com ThuVision Health has revolutionized the Weight Loss Industry - The Bar has been Set!HOW ""THE COMBO"" WORKS!THE BLUE & ORANGE CAPSULES WORK TOGETHER!One releases fat, letting go of cellulite and toxins while the other helps with appetite control and energy. So, if you're looking for LONG LASTING RESULTS then you MUST take them together and be CONSISTENT for them to work properly. It's the most effective and affordable plan on the market today and being 100% Plant Based its completely Safe!TruFix, ""the blue pill"", balances the blood chemistry... If your BMI is too high or too low your body is struggling! Your body is balanced through your blood chemistry so what that means is this is a WEIGHT MANAGEMENT system, not to be confused with a thermogenic, it balances the body to a healthy and balanced BMI. TruFix assists in cleansing the liver, lowering Cholesterol and balancing blood sugar. All of these things go hand in hand with cleansing the body, losing weight and increasing energy.Our weight loss combo is NOT a diet pill! It is a supplement, it balances your body internally. Your blood is responsible for feeding your organs and if you're organs are not getting the nutrients they need through the blood your organs will literally start pulling from other parts of the body trying to compensate for what they're not getting through the blood and this creates a negative spiral effect on your entire system making it virtually impossible to lose the weight and keep it off! So the goal is to give your blood the nutrients it needs so your organs get what they need to function properly without any strain on them. By doing this you leave the rest of the body relaxed and able to comfortably function the way it was intended to.Healthy Organs = Happy Body!! It is NOT likely that you will balance your body overnight as you did not get unhealthy/overweight overnight and it may take more time for some than others because our bodies are all very different, it can in some instances take 1 - 2 years to completely balance the Blood Chemistry. When you commit to losing weight and getting healthy our weight loss combo, when taken consistently will make that process so much easier. The TruFix is a MUST in this combo as it breaks away and dissolves that visceral fat.When taking traditional ""diet products"" that are thermogenic, you are forcing your body to lose weight, this does not last and you will put back on double the amount of weight you lost once you stop taking them!!The Combo works WITH your body, you see when you force the body to lose weight you also lose lean muscle mass and organ tissues can be depleted as well..... This is VERY unhealthy!! Low carb and low calorie diets can have this affect also. ""The Combo"" TruFix & Tru Weight/Energy are formulated to work together, for optimal results you must take them together! This will ensure that you retain your lean muscle tissue and deplete only the visceral fat aka. bad fat. You will also notice less weight lost in the breast tissue and that is because the TruFix dissolves the visceral fat and breast tissue is subcutaneous fat. Because Muscle weighs more than Fat and when your bloods getting the nutrients it needs its intern fueling your muscle also This is why many see inches coming off even when the weight remains the same.again The Combo is not a diet pill it is not a thermogenic product so if you are looking for quick weight loss solution. This is NOT it! If you are looking for Permenant Long Term Results Your in the right place!Visceral Fat vs TruFixVisceral fat is the unhealthy fat that collects around the waistline.

Our solution promotes regular check-ins, and is connected to a Clinician Dashboard, allowing care providers to monitor behaviours and warning signs of relapse.How it works:Patients are prompted to self-evaluate and submit regular personal assessments directly from the App, at a frequency defined by the clinician, and for the purpose of tracking progress and patterns of behaviour.After a quick self-assessment, TryCycle allows you to type or voice dictate a personal diary entry directly onto your phone so that your clinician can review these inputs as part of your treatment.  Additionally, the app will evaluate the sentiment of your diary to determine emotional tones as either positive, negative or neutral. Assessment data, diary entries, and other data collected by the app is used by your clinician to track your overall behaviours and emotional state, and will help determine if attention or intervention is necessary.TryCycle by itself is not sufficient to treat addiction, and is not intended to replace your existing treatment program or face-to-face contact with your clinician.";"TryCycle, TryCycle Data Systems Inc., Health & Fitness, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"2.0.0";17;"English";1363149350;"TryCycle Data Systems Inc.";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/trycycle-data-systems-inc/id1363149350?mt=8";0;NA;15,5;"2018-09-12";"2018-05-09";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;"2018-10-25";1;0;NA;NA;NA

Focused Cardiac Ultrasound (FOCUS) is the process of carrying out this rapid qualitative assessment by practitioners in these fields. Training for carrying out a FOCUS assessment requires practitioners to understand the 3D structures of the heart that are seen in the 2D transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) image.We have created this interactive application to assist with teaching and learning the assessment of normal and pathologic cardiac function with FOCUS. FOCUS assessments are based on a subset of 5 of the 20 standard TTE views:Parasternal long axisParasternal short axisApical four chamberSubcostal four chamberSubcostal inferior vena cavaUsers can view the TTE recordings for each of the 5 FOCUS views and see a corresponding 3D model of the probe, ultrasound plane, heart and rib cage for each view. Each FOCUS view can be selected from a menu at the left of the screen, or by using arrow buttons to go to the next or previous view in the list. For each view, the 3D model of the probe, ultrasound plane, heart and rib cage can be rotated in the horizontal or vertical plane to view it from any angle. The rib cage can be removed, the part of the heart above the echo plane can be removed, and the heart model can be oriented so the structures correspond to the TTE image.This module reviews the use of FOCUS to assess pericardial abnormalities of localised effusion and tamponade and their effect on cardiac function.*NOTE: This app has not yet been updated to include the right ventricle, left ventricle and hypovolemic pathologies found on the website. http://pie.med.utoronto.ca/TTE/TTE_content/focus.html";"TTE FOCUS Views, University Health Network, Medical, Education, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"3.0.0";17;"English";361257574;"University Health Network";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/university-health-network/id361257574?mt=8";4,99;"$";72,6;"2017-10-12";"2013-10-08";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;"2018-10-25";1;0;"Cardiology";NA;NA

You have found it now here!, this application You can cook by following a step-by-step recipe Turkish foods.Turkish cuisine varies across the country. The cooking of Istanbul, Bursa, Izmir, and rest of the Aegean region inherits many elements of Ottoman court cuisine, with a lighter use of spices, a preference for rice over bulgur, koftes and a wider availability of vegetable stews, eggplant, stuffed dolmas and fish. The cuisine of the Black Sea Region uses fish extensively, especially the Black Sea anchovy (hamsi) and includes maize dishes. The cuisine of the southeast -Urfa, Gaziantep and Adana- is famous for its variety of kebabs, mezes and dough-based desserts such as baklava, kadayif and kunefe.Especially in the western parts of Turkey, where olive trees grow abundantly, olive oil is the major type of oil used for cooking. The cuisines of the Aegean, Marmara and Mediterranean regions are rich in vegetables, herbs, and fish. Central Anatolia has many famous specialties, such as keskek, manti (especially from Kayseri) and gozleme.A specialty's name sometimes includes that of a city or region, either in or outside of Turkey, and may refer to the specific technique or ingredients used in that area. For example, the difference between Urfa kebab and Adana kebab is the thickness of the skewer and the amount of hot pepper that the kebab contains. Urfa kebab is less spicy and thicker than Adana kebab.Here is an example of Turkish foods menu recipes contained in this application:> Hailing from the south-east region of Turkey, this dish is typically eaten at weddings and symbolizes the building of a new home together..> This Turkish soup is made for the winter months..> The idea of putting spiced mince on a disc of dough would have occurred to human beings long time ago..> Partly out of laziness, partly out of convenience, Turkish restaurants outside Turkey have made swordfish on skewers a clich & eacute dish..> What we call stuffed vine leaves, dolma, in the UK are thought of as wrapped vine leaves, sarma, in Turkey..> These savoury stuffed flatbreads have become a staple at Aussie festivals and markets, but the one made for me was a cut above the rest..> The secret to making these spicy sausage and feta stuffed pastries is to brush a mixture of water, oil and a little bit of salt over the top before baking..> And Much more again you can get them on the application.All recipes use FREE simple ingredients that are easily available and inexpensive.

From its ancient roots in the use of musical tones to achieve calmness and connection for mind, body and spirit, it is now renewed in the era of smartphone technology.Welcome to U4Ea! We at amginE Ink are excited to offer you the next evolution of binaural beats  where mindfulness practiced the world over has been merged into a single app!Just as the benefits of mindfulness can bring about psychological, emotional and physical health benefits, U4Ea delivers an experience that is as much about the journey as it is about the destination.For the explorers of mindfulness, the multi-tasking meditators, the brain boosters, and anyone who wants to feel better, U4Ea offers a complement to your daily routines. amginE Ink has connected the benefits of musical tones and chakra energy points in the body to transition less desirable feelings and sensations to a preferred state of mind or mood. Through U4Ea, app users are in control of how they want to feel and how they choose to approach interacting with the world around them.HOW DOES U4Ea WORK?U4Ea uses the technology of passive focus on audio tones, or musical notes through binaural beats. Binaural beats help you achieve desired states of consciousness while you sleep, relax, meditate, experience joy, and get motivated. Within minutes or even seconds, your neural pathways interact with the HUM you hear and set the stage for improved learning, work, response to stress, improved meditation, even more restful sleep.Whether your subtle HUM blends seamlessly behind your favorite music and videos or plays alone, it is effective at any volume that you choose for your personal comfort.To get started, all you have to do is answer three questions: -  How do I want to feel? -  What personal attributes do I want to boost? -  And What am I preparing for?Each question will give you a list of options you can select from organized by color, tone, chakra, and attributes. Our algorithm works behind the scenes to blend the frequency outcome. All together, there are over 350 combinations available to help you get to where you want to be.Don't worry. If youre just getting started and your journey to mindfulness seems too heavy, we'll be sharing popular FrequentSies like ""Healing Sleep,"" ""Goodbye Hangover,"" and ""Workout Mojo"" on social media.But don't listen to the meditation, relax, or sleep frequencies when you're driving or operating heavy machinery!! And remember U4Ea encourages you to always follow the health and medical advice of your physician and treatment teams!! U4Ea works best as a compliment to your activities and routines. Please discuss any concerns with us or a health professional.APP FEATURESOnce you've made your selections and press play, your HUM will begin in a few seconds. Enjoy the visual display! The colors have the same effect as your selected tones.Under the Menu icon, you'll see the options to play, pause, stop, and SHARE the U4Ea love on Facebook, Twitter, and anywhere you want to post a link ;-)You'll also have a detailed description of how your selected tones are working their magic for you!Let us know how you like the app, either after you finish a session on U4Ea, with a review in the App Store, or anywhere you connect with us on social media.

To see your patient you place the tracker in the US mode of the app in front of your camera. Flat for a lying patient, on the wall for a standing patient and if you turn it 90 the patient is on it's side.After starting the app you choose the organ you'd like to scan. To see your patient you place the tracker in the US mode of the app in front of your camera. Once you move your camera onto the patient the image will change to the US mode and display the inner organs. Now you can place the patient in your preferred position.To record your development, you take an image anytime from any angle. The next lesson 'guided scan' guides you to the 'right' planes for the documentation. In the upper left corner you find our guiding tool (a red circle with dot).The white circle marks the 'ideal' plane, once the red guiding tool turns green (and the dot) its a good time to document your findings. Once an image is taken the second plane is displayed. After documenting the two planes you can double-check the images, discard and redo or if satisfied check your personal log.In the last step you scan several patients and document your findings.

How can we build more positive adult-child relationships? What careers might my children enjoy when they get older? Parents all over the world puzzle over questions like this. The answers arent always simple. Nobody can pretend that an app (or even a team of child psychologists) will provide them all - but MyTypeOfKid might give a few insights.MyTypeOfKid is easy to use and can provide practical, real, insights and ideas... based on Personality Type.  Pioneered by psychologist Carl Jung, its a popular and effective tool to aid understanding of differences between people.A few questions are used to help the parent evaluate or narrow down the Personality Type of the child. Then a range of output information can be browsed for that and other Personality Types, including:- Hints and tips for interacting more effectively- Disposition, how particular Personality Types may prefer to interact and play - How they may prefer to communicate - What might be helpful when they get displeased or cranky - How they may prefer to learn - How they may react to school - Which extracurricular activities they may prefer and excel at - How others may see them - What sort of career they may be drawn to - Famous people who might share that Personality Type Sometimes the initial Type identified can be startlingly accurate. In other situations it can take a little longer or the Type is less obvious. But to focus too much on the details of the match misses the point: the main benefit of understanding Type is not to 'Typecast', but to raise awareness and to encourage thinking about different personal needs and ways to interact.LimitationsThe concept of Psychological Type provides an overall framework for understanding differences between children, and between children and adults. The descriptions are based on observation, research and analysis of behaviour and preferences. Because all children are unique and still developing, they may not show all of the qualities or behaviours described or may not exhibit them with the same level of intensity. So the information presented in the app should not be taken as advice for interacting with individual children. But the general description should be familiar if the Type has been correctly identified.This app is intended to give only an overview of the value of understanding Psychological Type, and is not capable of delivering an individual in-depth analysis for every child.Note: The Younger than 5 button doesnt imply all children under 5 demonstrate sufficient preferences or behaviours to result in a full or accurate analysis. 5 years of age is simply a reasonable boundary to be able to ask more detailed questions.Generally, the older the child the more accurate. The outputs depend on accurate answers to the questions posed, and there is also no guarantee that Type theory will necessarily suit or fit everyone. For younger children, where there may not always be sufficient information to fully identify all the aspects of Personality Type, there can still be merit in identifying what is clear and observable, and in keeping the questions in mind so when the child does start to develop noticeable behaviour patterns, it may be easier to understand why. This app does not address the behaviours or preferences of babies, toddlers or of children faced with special mental or physical challenges - in such cases individual professional advice should be sought.A parent can use companion app MyTypeOfMum to evaluate their own and their partners Personality Types and browse through parental strengths, examine what different Types might prefer or enjoy as a parent, what they may find it less easy to do, some ideas to take a different approach, possible challenges and ideas for a whole range of Personality Types, not just their own.No advertising.

The final interpretation relies on the individuals experience and best available evidence. The University of Minnesota developed a useful tool that integrates the perspective and experience of several high volume transplant centers around the world. The University of Minnesota Lung Donor Quality Index (UMN-DLQI) is a consensus-based tool that estimates the likelihood of donor offer acceptance.11 transplant centers world-wide participated in an on-line survey that ranked 16 lung donor-recipient factors and graded their importance on a 0-10 scale. Magnitude estimation methods were used to arrive at consensus-based weights for each factor. The final result is an index value from 0-50. Preliminary research suggests that an index above 40 is a sensitive and specific marker for an offer that most centers would accept. The UMN-DLQI app allows the practitioner to quickly calculate the index. The app provides a useful screening tool to remind physicians that a score equal to or above 40 deserves considerable attention. In addition, the app facilitates multicenter investigations into the utility of donor scoring. Research on the use of UMN-DLQI is still ongoing and no definite conclusions can be made about the correlation of any particular score and the transplants outcome.";"University of Minnesota Donor Lung Quality Index (UMN-DLQI), Edward Bender, Medical, Education, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"1.3";12;"English";335096462;"Edward Bender";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/edward-bender/id335096462?mt=8";0;NA;0,852;"2015-02-01";"2015-01-13";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;"2018-10-25";1;0;"Surgery";NA;NA

He was traveling frequently from Australia to Germany to teach neurology and he had a problem with jet lag, so he decided to come up with a solution and discovered Uplift.  Uplift is based on the combination of the latest neurological science, mobile technology, and algorithms as well as 5,000 years of acupressure history.  Dr. Krebs has invented a new form of biorhythmic acupressure to update your neural network and we are delivering this solution to you from your mobile phone.  We have tested this solution on hundreds of international travelers and it is extremely effective in reducing the effects of Desynchronosis otherwise known as jet lag.  Everyone knows that jet lag impacts your sleep but also all your physiological systems including digestion, hormones, and body temperature. Everyone who travels around the globe knows that foggy, tired feeling that impacts the quality of your travel.  It can take you from 12 - 24 hours to adjust for each time zone crossed so you can lose out on quality time both going and coming home.By resynching your body clock and neutralizing jet lag your transition time is reduced and the quality of your journey across time zones is enhanced.  You may still be tired after a 6,12, or 24+ hour trip but you will not be fighting your body clock anymore, that kept you awake up at 3am staring at the ceiling before Uplift.

""I have already had my eyes opened to so many new tools in only one forty minute session with the app.""""Thank you so much. I'm seriously about to cry because today's session was so important and useful to me."" *SCIENCE*A pilot study of 80 UpLift users showed that in just 1 month, those who stuck with the program had nearly a 50% reduction in depression scores that lasted.UpLift was developed by expert psychologists and leaders from the field of mobile mental health. It's based on Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, which has been used to treat people with depression for over 30 years. ""UpLift is strongly aligned with the principles and methods of cognitive-behavioral therapy. A carefully done study has clearly demonstrated its positive outcomes for people who struggle with depression."" - Dr. Keith Dobson, Advisor and a world-renowned expert on CBT. He's been president of the International Association for Cognitive Psychotherapy and the Academy of Cognitive Therapy and the author or editor of over 15 books on CBT.*SESSIONS*UpLift provides you 11 interactive sessions that are around 45 minutes long each week. In the sessions, you'll be answering questions, doing mental exercises, and getting customized feedback and guidance.

Here's a sample of some of the tools you'll unlock with UpLift: - Problem Solver- Mood Journal- Trigger Plan- Thought Errors- Reframing Struggles- Goal Trainer- Mood Boosters*COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY*Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is a type of psychotherapy that was developed in the 1960s, based on the idea that modifying thought and behavior patterns was more important than understanding the psychological origins of behavior. Because this new method does not require the presence of a therapist, attempts were soon made to automate the process, first with bibliotherapy (CBT self-help books), and then with CCBT, or Computerized Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.UpLift is a new generation of CCBT (now called iCBT). UpLift uses our own proprietary programming technology to make it dynamic and responsive and modern UX design to make it a pleasure to use, while maintaining tried-and-proven CBT methods at it's heart.*PRICING*UpLift is free to download and the first session is free of charge. You can unlock all of the sessions and the entire toolkit via an auto-renewing subscription.

This app helps those who have already registered their service dogs, emotional support animals, or therapy animals to easily carry an electronic version of their registration ID cards which is conveniently stored within the app for online or offline access, plus allows new registrants the option to submit a registration application for an ID card, service dog vest, service dog leash, service dog tag, and other related products directly from our warehouse. Simply type in an existing registration number or the email address used when first registering and your virtual service dog ID card will be downloaded instantly to your device for quick access.By law, service dogs are generally allowed to go anywhere that is accessible to the public. According to the ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act), a service dog is a dog that is individually trained to do work or perform tasks for a person with a disability. These tasks include, but are not limited to: assisting a visually impaired person with mobility, alerting an individual with hearing impairments to sounds, assisting with the retrieval of medication and pulling wheelchairs. Emotional support animals are not governed by the ADA but are governed by the FHA (Fair Housing Act) and ACAA (Air Carrier Access Act), which allow owners to bring their emotional support animals (including dogs and cats) with them on airplanes and in housing, regardless of specific pet policies of the apartment complex or airline. Emotional support animals require a letter from a licensed therapist or physician in order to be considered legally qualifying. If you are planning to travel, please check with your airline in advance about their specific policy with respect to emotional support animals. Service dog registration and emotional support animal registration is not required nor endorsed by any federal agency or law, however many people do find that service dog ID cards, vests, and leashes go a long way towards reducing embarrassing (and sometimes illegal) questioning and confrontation when bringing your service dog with you into public places, since disabilities are not always obvious.USAServiceDogs.org proudly donates to Paws for Vets and The Seeing Eye, among other great organizations helping to train service dogs for disabled veterans in need.

The United States Medical Licensing Examination  (USMLE) is a three-step examination for medical licensure in the United States and is sponsored by the Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB) and the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME).The USMLE assesses a physician's ability to apply knowledge, concepts, and principles, and to demonstrate fundamental patient-centered skills, that are important in health and disease and that constitute the basis of safe and effective patient care. Each of the three Steps of the USMLE complements the others; no Step can stand alone in the assessment of readiness for medical licensure.Step 1USMLE Step 1 assesses whether medical school students or graduates understand and can apply important concepts of the basic sciences to the practice of medicine. As of 2007, it covers the following subjects, in both systemic (general and individual anatomical characteristics) and procedural (functional, therapeutic, environmental, and abnormality) themes:    Pathology,    Pharmacology,    Physiology,    Microbiology,    Biochemistry,    Anatomy,    Behavioral sciences,    Interdisciplinary topics, such as nutrition, genetics, and aging.US medical students take Step 1 at the end of the Basic Sciences portion of the curriculum, usually after the second year of medical school.The Step 1 score is frequently used in medical residency applications as a measure of a candidate's likelihood to succeed in that particular residency (and on that specialty's board exams).Step 2USMLE Step 2 is designed to assess whether medical school students or graduates can apply medical knowledge.Step 2-CKUSMLE Step 2 CK is designed to assess clinical knowledge through a traditional, multiple-choice examination. It is a 9 hour examStep 2-CSUSMLE Step 2 CS is designed to assess clinical skills through simulated patient interactions, in which the examinee interacts with standardized patients portrayed by actors. USMLE Step 3 is the final exam in the USMLE series designed to assess whether a medical school graduate can apply medical knowledge and understanding of biomedical and clinical science essential for the unsupervised practice of medicine.

Best USMLE Review App EVER!This Lite Version of the App contains only the first 100 Flashcards from High Yield topics, structured in a similar fashion to the First Aid book. ***Upgrade to our USMLE Step 1 Pro for a full index of all 10,000+ Flashcards.***All Topics Covered by This App: Behavioral Science, Biochemistry, Microbiology, Immunology, Pathology, Pharmacology, Cardiovascular, Endocrine, Gastrointestinal, Hematology & Oncology, Musculoskeletal, Neurology, Psychiatry, Renal, Reproductive, Respiratory & Rapid Review.  What is Spaced Repetition?Spaced repetition is a learning method that requires increasing intervals of time between periodic reviews of previously learned material in order to exploit the psychological spacing effect. Spaced repetition is commonly applied in contexts where a learner must acquire a large amount of knowledge and retain it indefinitely in memory such as when studying for a board exam or learning a second language. We have heavily researched many learning studies done by famous authors such as Hermann Ebbinghaus, Sebastian Leitner(Leitner System), Paul Pimsleur, A.W. Melton, Thomas Landauer, Robert A. Bjork, C. A. Mace & H. F. Spitzer from which we extracted the best concepts to ultimately create this technology focused USMLE Step 1 App. Our brilliant team of developers built this proprietary piece of technology which keeps track of when a particular flashcard was reviewed, prompts users to review it again 1 day later, a week later(7 days) & a month later(28 days so 4 weeks). Spacing reviews in this manner insures each flashcard will be learned at least 4 times which almost guarantees the material will be retained in the memory forever. Why learn in this manner? Well, the famous study on human memory done by German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus describes that within the first 24 hours of learning we forget 50% - 80% of what was learned and without further review, by 30 days we remember merely 2% of the information. Based on these results, Ebbinghaus created his well-known Learning curve & Forgetting curve. According to Ebbinghaus, spaced repetition is the most important factor in order to retain what was learned. Periodic reviews (every 24 hour, week and month later) provide the needed spikes in memory to retain large amount of information as long term memory. Awesome App Features: <U+25CF> Timestamp based flashcard tracking  Know exactly when you reviewed a particular flashcard. <U+25CF> Push Notifications   Once a day push notification at your usual study time to remind you to review your previously learned flashcards. <U+25CF> Support for iPad and iPad Pro.<U+25CF> Spaced Review Score  Instant updating score system based on spaced review target achieved or missed. <U+25CF> Fast Navigation through Flashcards  Bookmark, Favorite & Scroll through 100s of flashcards with ease. <U+25CF> Iconographic Review Reminders  Time based icon updates on every flashcard to remind users when to review a particular card.      ...    = Awaiting = Card will open in the future for review.      O    = Open = Flashcard needs to be reviewed NOW.      X     = Missed = Missed the 24hr window to review the card. Check = Done = Successfully reviewed the card.P.S.

We have put a great deal of effort into making this a reality and look forward to all feedback so we can constantly build top quality educational Apps.

What is Spaced Repetition?Spaced repetition is a learning method that requires increasing intervals of time between periodic reviews of previously learned material in order to exploit the psychological spacing effect. Spaced repetition is commonly applied in contexts where a learner must acquire a large amount of knowledge and retain it indefinitely in memory such as when studying for a board exam or learning a second language. We have heavily researched many learning studies done by famous authors such as Hermann Ebbinghaus, Sebastian Leitner(Leitner System), Paul Pimsleur, A.W. Melton, Thomas Landauer, Robert A. Bjork, C. A. Mace & H. F. Spitzer from which we extracted the best concepts to ultimately create this technology focused USMLE Step 1 Review App. Our brilliant team of developers built this proprietary piece of technology which keeps track of when a particular flashcard was reviewed, prompts users to review it again 1 day later, a week later(7 days) & a month later(28 days so 4 weeks). Spacing reviews in this manner insures each flashcard will be learned at least 4 times which almost guarantees the material will be retained in the memory forever. Why learn in this manner? Well, the famous study on human memory done by German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus describes that within the first 24 hours of learning we forget 50% - 80% of what was learned and without further review, by 30 days we remember merely 2% of the information. Based on these results, Ebbinghaus created his well-known Learning curve & Forgetting curve. According to Ebbinghaus, spaced repetition is the most important factor in order to retain what was learned. Periodic reviews (every 24 hour, week and month later) provide the needed spikes in memory to retain large amount of information as long term memory. Awesome App Features: <U+25CF> Timestamp based flashcard tracking  Know exactly when you reviewed a particular flashcard. <U+25CF> Push Notifications   Once a day push notification at your usual study time to remind you to review your previously learned flashcards. <U+25CF> Support for iPad and iPad Pro.<U+25CF> Spaced Review Score  Instant updating score system based on spaced review target achieved or missed. <U+25CF> Fast Navigation through Flashcards  Bookmark, Favorite & Scroll through 100s of flashcards with ease. <U+25CF> Iconographic Review Reminders  Time based icon updates on every flashcard to remind users when to review a particular card.      ...    = Awaiting = Card will open in the future for review.      O    = Open = Flashcard needs to be reviewed NOW.      X     = Missed = Missed the 24hr window to review the card. Check = Done = Successfully reviewed the card.P.S. We are making our technology and learning system as effective as possible, connect with us if you think we can do something else to make it even better.Additional Info-----------------CONTACT US: info@collabocards.comVISIT US: http://www.collabocards.com";"USMLE Step 1 Pro Flashcards App with Progress Tracking & Flashcard Review Spaced Repetition Score, http://itkakaam.com, Education, Medical, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"1.1";4;"English";1273610850;"IT KA KAAM Software Solutions Pvt Ltd";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/http-itkakaam-com/id1273610850?mt=8";9,99;"$";8,3;"2016-03-04";"2015-10-31";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;"2018-10-25";1;0;"Nutrition";"GinecologyAndObstetrics";"MentalHealth&Neurology"

The United States Medical Licensing Examination  (USMLE) is a three-step examination for medical licensure in the United States and is sponsored by the Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB) and the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME).The USMLE assesses a physician's ability to apply knowledge, concepts, and principles, and to demonstrate fundamental patient-centered skills, that are important in health and disease and that constitute the basis of safe and effective patient care. Each of the three Steps of the USMLE complements the others; no Step can stand alone in the assessment of readiness for medical licensure.Step 1USMLE Step 1 assesses whether medical school students or graduates understand and can apply important concepts of the basic sciences to the practice of medicine. As of 2007, it covers the following subjects, in both systemic (general and individual anatomical characteristics) and procedural (functional, therapeutic, environmental, and abnormality) themes:    Pathology,    Pharmacology,    Physiology,    Microbiology,    Biochemistry,    Anatomy,    Behavioral sciences,    Interdisciplinary topics, such as nutrition, genetics, and aging.US medical students take Step 1 at the end of the Basic Sciences portion of the curriculum, usually after the second year of medical school.The Step 1 score is frequently used in medical residency applications as a measure of a candidate's likelihood to succeed in that particular residency (and on that specialty's board exams).Step 2USMLE Step 2 is designed to assess whether medical school students or graduates can apply medical knowledge.Step 2-CKUSMLE Step 2 CK is designed to assess clinical knowledge through a traditional, multiple-choice examination. It is a 9 hour examStep 2-CSUSMLE Step 2 CS is designed to assess clinical skills through simulated patient interactions, in which the examinee interacts with standardized patients portrayed by actors.

The stimulation device is using low power magnetic fields, haptic stimulation and sound to activate the vagus nerve and brain. This activation is modulating the bodys existing signals that travel between the brain, heart, and gut via the neck vagus nerve. This modulation helps the brain and nervous system to relax, focus or energize.Each dose is 15 minutes long. We recommend 1-3 doses per day for one week but already one fifteen minutes session is enough to feel the effect. Maximum daily dosage should be limited to 4.

This will help in the planning of and performing a mitral Valve in Valve or Valve in Ring case. The application navigates the user through important aspects of surgical mitral valves, mitral rings and TAVI valve design, which are vital for a successful Valve in Valve or ring procedure. The app logically steps through the possible combinations to give the user specific information needed to perform the procedure.Success of a Valve in Valve or ring procedure is based on correct identification of the surgical valve or Ring, choosing the correct size of the TAVI valve and its subsequent accurate placement. Surgical valves and rings vary in appearance under fluoroscopy and also in their internal diameter. Similarly TAVI valves differ in their appearances and available sizes.Knowledge about all the surgical valves and rings that have been implanted in the last two decades is minimal but relevant to the Valve in Valve or ring therapy. Users can now familiarize themselves with important design information about surgical valves, rings and TAVI valves; they can also select the valve and find out which size of TAVI valve could be used and how it is best placed during a Valve in Valve or ring procedure.It also gives information about differences between TAVI valve sizing for mitral and aortic valve in valve procedure. Mitral ring properties, which will have a big implication when considering a valve in ring procedure are also discussed. It alerts the user about potential problems especially when considering valve in ring in certain designs.The Valve In Valve Mitral app can be used to plan a case and confirm suitability for this procedure and reduces the need to trawl through vast amounts of literature to find information specific to the clinical scenario. The information is also available without the need for an internet connection and will enhance the users understanding of various aspects of this procedure.

Vaping mods are the vaping atomizer system that allow the user to design their own heading system of coils to achieve a desired level, temperature and taste of cloud (formerly known as smoke for smokers).  The user change the critical parameters of their design and see what temperature results and whether or not we have a safe and recommended coil design. Central Screen    This screen is the central design screen.  Other screen are called form here to support details of you design.  The slider bar on the left provides a list of coil count options.  As you slide this bar, the image at the top changes to show you how the system is assuming you are winding the coil.  As you slide the bar, the design parameters are re-calculaged and the solution is show to the user in the form of the following fields:        Note:  A design consists of a coil wrapped a fixed number of turns or loops connected to a battery and made of a specified resistive wire.  The loops have a fixed diameter also specified.  The coil has extra wire on either end to connect the coil to the terminals.        Recommendation String - Just below the image is a string with the recommending whether or not this design will produce desired results        Resistance - The resulting impedance or resistance of the coil in Ohms.  This also takes into consideration how long are the ends of the coil from the coil to the terminal.        Temperature - This is hte temperature in degrees F of the coil after it heats up.  This temperature is critial to achieving vapor of a desired temperature and taste.        Note:  Experiment with different recommended temperature until you get the desired taste.  Then you know what temperate/wick combination gives you the taste you like. From here, you can make many different designs but use VapingMods on each coil to achieve this temperature.  For example, if you have a dual coil wire, make sure each coil will produce this temperature.  They you will double essentially the same temp and taste but twice the volume.        Wire - This is what resistive wire you are using for the mod.  Tap in this field or just select the wire button at the bottom (for iPhone 4+) or scroll the wire table already present (for the iPad). to select the desired wire.  Nearly all mods are made either from Kenthal or NiChrome wires.  Both are provided for your selection and design        Gauge - This shows the gauge (or thickness) of the wire.        Note:  If you go to the utility menu (accessed from the upper left folder on the top left corner of navigation bar, you can change the length measurement units.  Now all will be calculated in Metrics.).        Length (Len.) - This is the overall length of the coil and ends if you were to strtech it out to a linear wire.        Loop Diameter - This is the diameter of the shaft around which you are wrapping the wire to achieve a coil.  It is the coik inside diameter.        Battery - This is the battery being used in the mod.  You can tap this field to select a new battery or you can tap the battery button on the botton as was the case for the wire.        Volage - This comes with the battery as a parameter of the battery.  It is not used selectable but user in relevant calculations (i.e Power)        Current - This is the current deliver capacity of the battery. Again...

We have such a tendency to start to feel like our partner is kind of a part of us. And when theres a break up it can feel like we are losing a part of ourselves. That can be really painful!Typically heartbreak lasts a long time and is the source of a lot of suffering. But now it doesnt have to be that way any more. Now it is possible to vaporize the pain of heartbreak quickly and easily using this amazing new app. Based on what you have known in the past, you might not be able to believe that it is possible to get rid of heartbreak and that you just have to live with it and ride out the pain. But thats not necessary any more. With this app it is possible to get over the pain of heartbreak much faster than ever before. Instead of it taking months or years to get over it, it can be resolved in a few hours or even less. Just imagine having the pain of your heartbreak gone and feeling whole and complete and at peace again. Its nice to imagine that but its not going to happen just by imagining it. But now it can happen as a result of using this amazing new app. Thats because the app uses a new technology for powerfully and permanently resolving heartbreak and all kinds of emotional pain.This way of getting rid of your heartbreak is new. It is something you most certainly havent tried before because if you had used something this effective you wouldnt need to be checking out this app. The thing that is different about this app is that it shows you how to do the opposite of what you have been deeply conditioned to do your whole life. People are not good at resolving their disruptive emotions, especially ones that are intense. Everyone learns to suppress and avoid painful emotional feelings as a result of getting emotionally overwhelmed many times when you were very young. This is universal. It happens to everybody. Emotions have both content and energy. Most approaches focus on the content. That doesnt work very well. This app shows you how to resolve the energy that causes your heartbreak. Its a totally new approach and it really works. And best of all  its free! I know it seems a bit outrageous and even might sound too good to be true but now you can really vaporize your heartbreak and have it be gone for good. Dont take my word for it.

Testing is done in a logarithmic progression. This progression results in every three rows representing a halving or doubling of visual acuity levels. This allows for better interpretation of the significance of noted visual acuity changes because a three line difference in the higher acuity ranges would represent the same degree of change as a three line difference in the lower acuity ranges. Also, the separation between optotypes between rows of optotypes has been standardized to be proportional to the size of the optotypes. This results in smaller spacing in the higher visual acuity levels, and wider spacing in the lower visual acuity levels. This method of visual acuity testing was based on the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study Distance Visual Acuity Chart.Significant loss of contrast sensitivity is common among low vision patients. Advanced diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and neurological disease is strongly associated with significantly reduced contrast sensitivity.Contrast refers to the darkness of the object compared to the lightness of the background. The highest quality print may have 85 to 95% contrast. US paper currency is printed with 55 to 60% contrast. A gray car approaching an intersection on a shaded street has approximately a 30% contrast, whereas a dark car on a sunny street may have approximately 80% contrast.Uniqueness of the iPad Variable Contrast Acuity ChartsWhereas conventional eye charts test visual acuity at one level of contrast, the iPad Contrast Sensitivity Eye Charts can measure visual acuity at 100% contrast (the highest contrast) to 1.25% contrast (the lowest contrast). Also, visual acuity can be tested at three different distances; 40 cm (16 inches), 2 meters (6.5 feet), and 3 meters (10 feet) whereas most conventional eye charts can be used only one distance. The iPad Variable Contrast Acuity Charts' ease-of-use allows for assessment of contrast sensitivity without requiring a separate visit and lengthy testing with separate charts. Visual acuity is designated in Snellen equivalents as well as Meter Units (M System).";"Variable Contrast Sensitivity Chart by King-Devick, King-Devick Test, LLC, Medical, Health & Fitness, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"1.7";4;"English";424793545;"King-Devick Test LLC";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/king-devick-test-llc/id424793545?mt=8";19,99;"$";13,1;"2017-01-19";"2012-06-07";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;"2018-10-25";1;0;"SensorySystemsHealthcare";"Cardiology";"DiabetesCare"

The app consists of 3 calculators which use patient-specific data in order to generate a predictive score.The ""Standard"" calculator uses the widely-used predictive model published in Grobman, William A., et al., Development of a nomogram for prediction of vaginal birth after cesarean delivery, Obstetrics & Gynecology, volume 109(4), pp. 806-812, 2007. This predictive model uses pre-pregnancy BMI and prior medical history to predict VBAC success rates. It can be used at any time during the term of pregnancy during a clinical visit.The ""Standard + Admission Factors"" calculator is a variant of the 2007 Grobman prediction method as found in the following publication: Grobman William A., et al., Does information available at the time of admission for delivery improve prediction of successful birth after cesarean? American Journal of Perinatology, volume 26(10), pp.693-701, 2009. This model uses additional information at time of hospital admission to predict VBAC success rates.Lastly, the ""Simple"" calculator also uses information at time of admission (same as the ""Standard + Admissions Factors"" calculator). The source for this predictive calculator is: Metz, Tori D., et al., Simple, validated vaginal birth after cesarean delivery prediction model for use at the time of admission, Obstetrics & Gynecology, volume 122(3), pp.571-578, 2013.

I feel like I had been waiting for this one forever! (Consonantly Speaking)****Verbs News is a fun and creative language-therapy app for the iPad created by a certified speech and language pathologist for students to learn and practice verbs in four different tenses (simple present, present continuous, simple past, and simple future). It has a total of over 190 regular and irregular verbs represented in beautiful real-life pictures. Children are welcomed by a boy named Andrew, who is a newsroom anchor. Andrew has his own channel, Intro to Tenses, in which children can watch four different animated movies that visually explain four different English tenses. After they watch ""Intro to Tenses"", they may begin to practice the verbs. For each correct response, the children are awarded with an anchor microphone. At the end of the session, children can take the role of an anchor, record their own news, and watch it in the newsroom. (The video recordings are not saved in this app to comply with HIPPA.*)Verbs News can be used for students with:- language disorders and delays, such as specific language learning disorders, etc.- learning disorders- autism Verbs News allows students to practice verbs through three different activity types:- auditory bombardment- fill-in - make-up sentences (with audio recording feature)Verbs News is easy to navigate and allows users to employ several tools, enabling them to perform the following tasks: - enter multiple students- change settings - select multiple words- select multiple activity types - select auto-scoring- select alternate counts for multiple students - enable or disable written picture descriptions - enable or disable the award system- use the video/audio record feature- use the audio recording feature - track correct and incorrect responses - view reports- e-mail results at the end of the game*To comply with HIPAA standards this app does not allow the user to save the video recordings to protect the privacy of others.

Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) is caused by microscopic pieces of calcium bouncing around in your inner ears. Vertigo can be treated with drugs that dull the sensations, but drugs don't fix the problem. The preferred treatment for vertigo is a set of movements (the ""Epley Maneuver"") you can perform to guide those little calcium particles back into place. Many people find that the Epley Maneuver stops the vertigo attack, or at least lessens the intensity. Doctors and physical therapists teach their patients the Epley Maneuver so that they can treat themselves whenever vertigo strikes. The Vertigo Help app takes you through each step of the Epley Maneuver. And if you're too dizzy to focus on the words, you can turn on the audio and the app will talk you through each step. You can find all the information in this app online, and I did that and copied it onto a piece of paper -- which I could never find when I needed it -- but my iPhone is always with me.  When I have vertigo, I'm sitting in a chair hoping I won't throw up again.  I have trouble focusing my eyes because they are rapidly shifting back and forth, so I use the illustrations in this app and the audio turned on to walk me through the steps.

The scope of veterinary medicine is wide, covering all animal species, both domesticated and wild, with a wide range of conditions which can affect different species.Veterinary medicine is widely practiced, both with and without professional supervision. Professional care is most often led by a veterinary physician (also known as a vet, veterinary surgeon or veterinarian), but also by paraveterinary workers such as veterinary nurses or technicians. This can be augmented by other paraprofessionals with specific specialisms such as animal physiotherapy or dentistry, and species relevant roles such as farriers.Veterinary science helps human health through the monitoring and control of zoonotic disease (infectious disease transmitted from non-human animals to humans), food safety, and indirectly through human applications from basic medical research. They also help to maintain food supply through livestock health monitoring and treatment, and mental health by keeping pets healthy and long living. Veterinary scientists often collaborate with epidemiologists, and other health or natural scientists depending on type of work.

You can also use it to target market  your clients using the e-books within the ap, use it as a tool to win over new clients and convert phone shoppers too! Do you want your clients to view your practice as innovative with a high standard of client care? Do you want your clients to leave your consultation feeling completely satisfied with the level of information received? Do you want your clients to be able to go home and correctly educate other family members about their pet's health requirements? Do you want to STOP your clients from Googling their pets condition when they leave your consultation room? Do you want to see an increase in patient compliance and willingness to accept your recommendations? Do you want a powerful tool to convert phone shoppers and attract more new clients?If you said 'YES' to any of the above, then you'll love the iConsult. It delivers all of these things and more.Increase complianceYour clients need to be comfortable with your diagnosis to accept your treatment plan! If you can't educate your clients effectively, you're in trouble. The iConsult helps you to achieve a comfortable 'Yes, please proceed' from your client.Convert phone shoppersNeed a powerful way to attract phone shoppers to choose your practice without dropping prices? The iConsult will help you! When you purchase the iConsult we'll fill you in on a secret with how to get more clients calling you back to make an appointment for their pets surgical procedure or appointment.Educate your client effectivelyClients retain just 20% of what you tell them during a consultation. Don't believe me? Have you heard a client say 'I wasn't told that' when you absolutely 100% know you told them? It's even written in your history but they swear they weren't told! Or perhaps you've overheard a client on the phone after a consultation telling their spouse wrong information about their pet not even 5 minutes after they left the consult room? The iConsult will make sure your client understands more and they can go home and 'refresh their memory' with the e-book you will send free of charge straight from the iPad in 3 seconds.Increase value to your servicesAre you still trying to explain a surgical procedure to your client using hand gestures or by stick drawings? Really? You want a client to say 'Yes' to a $3,000 TTA procedure with charades? With so much competition in the veterinary industry, you can't afford for a client to go for a second opinion or Dr Google themselves out of the procedure altogether. The iConsult will effectively and professionally help you educate your clients. There will be no need for Dr Google or second opinions.Staff training & consistencyHave all vets in your practice use the iConsult during every consult and send e-books. If you do, it doesn't matter if your veterinarian has been out of university for 2 years or 10 years, the client will receive the same level of information. The iConsult will bring all of your vets to the same standard. It's also a great training tool for nurses!Retain clientsIt's amazing how many clients will seek out a new vet because they 'just weren't happy' with their last vet. Why weren't they happy? Most of the time it's because the delivery of information by the veterinarian did not meet their expectations. Can you afford to lose clients?

Separate medical notes can be added/saved.No internet connection needed.IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR VERSION 3.0:Currently supported dose units are mg/kg, mg/kg/hr, ml/kg, ml/kg/hr, and units/kg, units/kg/hr.Included are sample drug lists for canine and feline emergency (CPR) and antibiotic drug calculations. You can change (add, edit, sort, or remove) these drugs lists to create your own version of these lists so that you have the parameters (e.g. doses) that you typically use.  Also included are examples of other organizing Categories (Equine, Exotics, Food Animal, and Other) that do not have any current drug lists associated with them.

VetSpotting is a convenient, free app that sits on your phone. If your pet needs care, bring up the app and wait comfortably at home for a veterinarian to come to you. Its that simple. All veterinarians are licensed and experienced at providing home care.Step 1: Request a house callYour house call will go out to our veterinarians in their service area. At this time, this includes: The Chicago neighborhoods of Lakeview, and north of Lakeview to the northern limits of Chicago; and Chicagos northern suburbs along Lake Michigan up to and including Lake County.Provide basic information about the pet and the house call location, then press Request House Call.Step 2: Receive house call optionsYou may receive one or more responses from interested veterinarians. Each response will include at least one possible date and time for the house call, and possibly a second option. Both options will be within six days of the request.You may pick any of the proposed options (but a maximum of one). You may also elect to pick none of the options on offer for any reason, and seek care elsewhere.Step 3: Confirm a house callTo confirm a house call, pick one of the dates and times on offer.You will then be asked to pre-authorize payment. The pre-authorization is only a hold; the actual payment will only be made when the house call is completed. The pre-authorization provides assurance to our veterinarian that the house call is valid.Payment can be made using PayPal or a credit card, and is facilitated by Braintree, a PayPal company. Note: VetSpotting does not see your payment information and your payment means are not read by or stored on any VetSpotting server. Braintree manages the entire process.Step 4: Receive careThe veterinarian will visit at the agreed date and time. The visit may be preceded by a call to you from the veterinarian.Should circumstances change, you may contact the veterinarian to arrange a different time. While our veterinarians are experienced at providing in-home care, emergencies can happen, and the veterinarian may also contact you to modify arrangements.If you feel that such modifications are not satisfactory, contact VetSpotting at info@vetspotting.com or at 312 625 2696.Upon completion of the visit, you will be asked to sign the veterinarians screen to acknowledge the visit. You will then receive a care form documenting the veterinarians exam findings and plans for your pet. Your receipt of this form will also trigger the payment for the visit.";"VetSpotting, Mokko, Lifestyle, Health & Fitness, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"1.4.8";12;"English";1176883505;"Mokko LLC";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/mokko/id1176883505?mt=8";0;NA;14,5;"2018-05-22";"2018-01-29";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;"2018-10-25";1;0;NA;NA;NA

Pain sufferers take control of their pain by wearing a programmable mesh wrap. These wraps apply subtle, controlled vibrations to the pain affected areas and control the amplitude, duration and frequency of vibration. These vibrations block pain signals in the spinal cord that affect pain perception in the brain offering an innovative approach to the classic pain-management theory known as pain-gating. The therapeutic effects of vibration on pain relief have been well documented for decades. Numerous studies have demonstrated the benefits of vibration include:<U+2043>Pain reduction<U+2043>Soothes and relaxes agitated nerves<U+2043>Major reduction in swelling<U+2043>Increase range in motion<U+2043>Improvement in blood circulation<U+2043>Improved lymphatic system functionality<U+2043>Increase in mineral bone density  Vibrant's self-care approach to pain management is a cost-effective and sustainable alternative to drug-therapy.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFhpYu_dROE";"Vibrant, Neurovative Inc., Medical, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"1.1";4;"English";985872024;"Neurovative Tech Inc";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/neurovative-inc/id985872024?mt=8";0;NA;26,5;"2015-10-31";"2015-10-28";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;"2018-10-25";1;0;"MentalHealth&Neurology";"SensorySystemsHealthcare";"Cardiology"

This tool generates video clips directly during the match through the use of instant tagging. Determine several tactical tags. Choose the length of clip, and catch the most important moments in learning situations during real play! The different tags are stored in a clear dashboard to provide players directly with tactical feedback in the game. Give pointers or instructions to players by drawing in the player screen with a free hand drawing tool. Export these clips to others by using several standard share options. Video-catch uses the iPad camera as the standard option. Tagging in other camera positions is available by the Wi-Fi signal from an action camera (i.e. Sony HDR-AZ1VB), or IP-camera that is connected to an Apple Airport.

Appropriate for yoga practitioners looking to deepen their practice by having ample time to build physical and energetic endurance as well as harnessing a deeper meditative focus by uniting breath and movement ~ the foundation of Vinyasa itself.This app contains over one hour of video and dozens of wallpaper images.The Sun Salutations are taught intentionally with detailed alignment. The practice is connected through asanas of forward folds, arm balancing, hip openers, inversions, spinal twists, ending with Savasana, a deep reclining meditation. This practice is sequenced carefully with attention to pose and counter pose to reveal a dynamic energy that pulsates within and leaves each person feeling connected to the universal energy of love ~ the heart of yoga. Yoga is our life, and our presence, our awareness in each moment, is our greatest gift.Teaching since 2000 Maral has studied Iyengar, Vinyasa Flow, Ashtanga, Anusara, and AcroYoga. To the many teachers that have generously donated their hearts to Maral's growth: Michael Fukumura, David Swenson, John Friend, Jai Uttal, Govindas & Radha, and AcroYoga teachers Jenny and Jason, and of course her husband Manel and her Mama Leela who began practicing in 1977 and whom brought this practice to a little girl who never knew this is what her calling would be.";"Vinyasa Flow Yoga-Intermediate and Advanced AppVideo-Maral Hadidi, Joe Riehl, Health & Fitness, Lifestyle, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"4.1";4;"English";1298141610;"Sanguine Corporation";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/joe-riehl/id1298141610?mt=8";1,99;"$";62,6;"2015-03-02";"2010-08-24";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;"2018-10-25";1;0;"Cardiology";NA;NA

These metrics and data are often resident in disparate human and non-human sources, and are communicated to stakeholders through various modalities. Furthermore, coordinating care in a patient-centric manner is difficult as many stakeholders are continuously changing. To enable better patient management and communication, Vios has created a real-time platform for complete patient-centric exchange, consumption, aggregation, distribution, archival, and management of critical information and relationships between human or non-human parties or entities that interact with patient or patient-related data. This platform will enable comprehensive interactivity with critical patient-oriented data between parties or entities that interact with patients or patient data throughout the care continuum.Vios App is a care co-ordination mobile application for iOS used by caregiver users such as Nurse, Physicians. The Vios App receives continuous rhythm and vitals data from the Vios monitoring platform including Vios wearable bio sensors from patients in hospital. Clinical alarms raised by the Vios monitoring platform in hospital are also pushed to the remote user's Vios app. The Vios App also allows users to co-ordinate care such as by sharing voice notes, pictures and video from the care location.";"Vios App, Vios Medical Inc., Medical, Health & Fitness, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"1.45.00b";17;"English";1224555485;"Vios Medical Inc";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/vios-medical-inc/id1224555485?mt=8";0;NA;27,7;"2018-09-25";"2017-04-27";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;"2018-10-25";1;0;NA;NA;NA

Exposure to poor air quality has been linked to asthma & cardiovascular diseases such as strokes, heart disease, and even cancer. Air pollution is the world's largest single environmental health risk. If reducing air pollution could save our children & millions of lives, why don't we care more? Introducing project Virida. We want to provide a solution to the world where every person can find out what their surrounding air quality is like and how it impacts them. We need this solution to be affordable, portable, accurate, and integrated with a smart device. There is no such device in the market that successfully adopts all 4 of these principles in order to ensure global widespread adoption. Project Virida aims to drive maximum air quality awareness and the importance of green energy as it applies to our health. Why do all of this? To connect people & show them directly with tangible evidence why green energy matters on an extremely personal level. Green energy is more than just about reducing climate change or improving economic sustainability. It's about maintaining the health of our communities and the health of our children. If we can successfully bridge this gap, then we all collectively win.Project Virida comes in two phases. The first phase is this app that we have included default features such as:   - Ability to retrieve air quality summary from airnow.gov and aqicn.org for the current region you are in. For this version, the app is optimized for continental US region only.   - Along with the ability to retrieve air quality forecast data.   - Can show all air quality monitoring sites on the map from any city in the world.   - Ability to notify you when air quality is unhealthy and also the daily air quality alert.The second phase is the release of the air quality sensor module that will be connected and transmit data to the app via Bluetooth.

They are the content of our character and the basis of genuine happiness.The VIRTUES REFLECTION CARDS offer an opportunity to reflect on, practice andstrengthen our qualities of character to transform our lives. THE SOURCE of the research and content of the Virtues Reflection Cards is The Virtues Project, a global initiative, now in more than 140 countries. The Virtues Project is endorsed by the Dalai Lama and was honored by the United Nations during the International Year of the Family as a ""model global program for families of all cultures"".THE VIRTUES PROJECT INSPIRES INDIVIDUALS to live more authentic, joyful lives,FAMILIES to raise children of compassion and integrity, EDUCATORS to create safe, caringand high performing learning communities & LEADERS to inspire excellence and ethics in the workplace. The virtues cards were created by The Virtues Project Founders; Linda Kavelin Popov, Dr. Dan Popov and John H. Kavelin.How To Use The Reflection Cards:There are many ways to use the Virtues Reflection Cards: for guidance in making a decision, healing a relationship, clarifying our direction, or simply providing a spiritual focus for the day. They are a unifying activity when used in a sharing circle. When we receive a virtue, it is either  an affirmation or an invitation and sometimes both. Below are just a few ideasFor a Random Pick: Shake your device side to side, or click the icon in the lower left-hand corner. To flip to the back side of the card, click on the icon in the centre of the lower navigation bar.Personal Virtues Pick: Randomly pick a virtue. Read the card, and reflect on its meaning for you at this time. You may want to pose a question before you receive your card. Journal it and keep a record of the virtues that appear for you each day.To Begin a Meeting: Invite someone to randomly pick a virtue and read it aloud. Use the pick to help focus the meeting. At the close of the meeting, ask how it was helpful. Start your day or week by picking one virtue for your team. Acknowledge each other when you see the virtue in action.Sharing Circle: While sitting in a circle of family, friends, colleagues or community each person takes a turn to speak briefly about what is on his or her mind. Then the person randomly selects a card and reads it aloud, and shares how it speaks to them. The others in the circle listen in complete, respectful silence. When each person finishes sharing, others acknowledge a virtue they see in that person.

Native support for the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch Creates a list of visits for each day with the CPT codes and RVU values displayed Supports virtually all visit types, including inpatient and outpatient, new and return visits and nursing home visits Learn to enter exactly what you need to get paid for the visit Watch the effect each component has on the final code level Demonstrates the importance of some of the less appreciated components of the visit such as the differential diagnosis, the review of history from a family member, or the clinicians own brief review of a study Useful for instruction as well as for everyday use Support for emailing visit information and CPT codes Stores the visits for future reference Choose between the 1995 and 1997 CMS guidelines (both are acceptable to Medicare and insurers) Integrates important tips and CMS E&M Guidelines can be viewed within the app for referenceMost clinicians undercode. This can arise from confusion with the complexity and vague language of the CMS E&M Guidelines. It also can be the result of coding by time, which will virtually always undervalue the visit. By experimenting with entering the components of the visit into the app, the clinician can learn the most efficient way to document a visit and then spend the rest of the time giving the patient what they need. The clinician can then also tailor the remainder of the documentation more informally so it is optimized to be useful for clinical care.The app is based on the 1995 and 1997 CMS Documentation Guidelines for Evaluation and Management Services, 2016 Current Procedural Technology and the January 2016 RVU tables.While every effort has been made to ensure that calculations are accurate and in accordance with the guidelines and code books, use of this application is entirely at your own risk.

It can bring your yoga experience to a new level by deepening and strengthening your yoga practice.Many yoga practitioners forget that yoga is not just a physical exercise. It is also an ancient practice that enables us to impact the part of the human body that you cant see or touch, the subtle energy body. This occurs via the redistribution of life energy (prana) and the revitalization and balancing of special energy centers (chakras) in the body.According to ancient Indian teachings, the performance of every yoga pose, called asanas, enhances the movement of internal energy (prana) in the energy centers (chakras) in the subtle energy body. Each energy center is associated with certain systems, organs, and glands in the physical body of man.Thus, performing yoga poses activates the movement of energy in specific chakras, producing positive effects on the functioning of the bodys systems and organs associated with the activated energy centers.Are the chakras and energy body real?As we know from physics, we live in an ocean of wave energy invisible to our eyes. An easy way to verify the existence of the invisible ocean of energy waves is to turn on the mobile phone, radio, or television. In order to work, they must use the unseen, but real, electromagnetic waves.Of course, our energy body consists of thinner and higher energy waves than the ones which are used in those devices. Chakras are special energy vortexes in our energy body which, like antennas, are tuned to its own vibrational frequency and used to receive and transmit certain energies in the environment.There are 7 major chakras:Root chakra Sacral chakra Solar Plexus chakra Heart chakra Throat chakra Third Eye chakra Crown chakra Why are the prana flows and chakras important?Some researchers believe that the human body gets no more than 30% of its energy from food; the rest enters the human body through the chakras, directly as energy. The ancient Indians called this life force prana. A way to help understand that the level of human energy does not solely depend on the amount of food eaten, is to think about how small children may eat little but can run endlessly from dawn to dusk. Then look at adults who consume kilos of food but barely have any energy. For another example, look at the monks who eat very modestly but can do a lot of hard, physical work every day.So, the ability of chakras to receive and transmit prana energy and the features of the prana flows define the level of energy in the human body and therefore human health.Visual Yoga app depicts the intensification of the movement of energy in the energy centers and is intended to facilitate the visualization of these processes while performing yoga poses.Features of the Visual Yoga app:-72 yoga poses in HD video* with detailed visualization of the prana energy and chakras activation -Step-by-step instructions and descriptions of benefits for each pose-Learn more about the connection between each yoga pose and chakras -Create your own programs: choose the order of poses and duration of each pose -4 different backgrounds  Infinity, Space, Ocean, and Studio-Five soothing music tracks available to create a peaceful atmosphere -Available for iPhone and iPad * For stable and fast downloading of videos, please use a high-speed Internet connection.Its well known that focus is one of the main requirements for achieving results in any activity. The higher the concentration on the activity, the better the results will be.

As busy residents who are always pressed for time during our inpatient rotations, we often read only the abstract and discussion sections of large articles to glean the studys essential information. Although we may save time, we also risk missing important information.This frustration led to the concept of VisualMed  a visually appealing representation of the major points of clinical studies that can provide a resource for practitioners with limited time to review scientific articles.Visual abstracting is a relatively new idea, though multiple journals are now using them to disseminate more knowledge through social media.

By using Vita, you can tap into true health and well-being through the basic use of water, breathing and sunlight. With Vita you can remind yourself to better yourself. We feel that routinely partaking in proper water, breathing and sunlight techniques you can fill your body with the things it truly needs -- all the while making yourself feel the best you've ever felt. It's all up to you and at your own speed. You can set reminders for any day of the week and any hour of the day. If you are overwhelmed by too many reminders you can adjust your settings at any time with our simple layout. You can also build up to your ultimate goals by starting off slowly and ramping up as you meet your goals. We practice what we preach and if you simply meet your daily goals you will feel and become a better you. S.A.D is a real concern this day and age.

Also by engaging in deep breathing techniques you can help knock out stress and relax while giving your body the oxygen it desperately needs. Last but not least -- water. With the busy lives we live we often forget to get the proper amount of water. Caffeinated drinks dehydrate us and a small amount of water is simply not enough.What's New: Vita now includes notifications and glances for Apple Watch.Features:- Locked screen banner notifications with actionable buttons.

Ill pick you up at 3.VITACARE is based on years of research by Adapted LivingTM and is an innovative and unique software product that allows caregivers, either personal or professional, to maintain constant communications with their loved one (or client).  This constant contact significantly enhances the quality of life and independence of seniors, particularly those with memory limitations, who require more support than is allowed by the busy schedules of the caregiver, or by the distance that separates loved ones. VITACARE is, at its core, a messaging, reminder and monitoring system that is highly simplified for both users (caregivers and care recipients) and is packed with features that makes constant contact a reality. Messages are continuously scrolled on the tablet or smartphone screen and can be acknowledged and/or replied to by the client. Urgent messages are displayed in a vivid font and color and all messages include the photo of the sender. Messages that have been acknowledged or replied to are not deleted from the screen but are struck out, reminding the client that s/he has responded to the message. Messages that have not been acknowledged are highlighted back to the caregiver for action.In addition to the core messaging, a comprehensive and prioritized client TO DO list (tasks) and Calendar (events) are available on the home screen (Todays List) and can be generated and appended to by the authorized caregivers. Events appearing on the simplified Calendar are automatically appended to the task list with their associated times and alarms. Tasks that have been completed are not removed from the list but are struck out (and moved to the bottom of the task list) to remind the client that the task has been completed. Tasks that have not been acknowledged generate a message to the caregiver in a timely manner. Tasks that have not been completed are carried forward to the next day (at midnight) and a message is sent to the caregiver for information and/or action.A simplified Address Book is also included and features not only the names, numbers and addresses of important contacts but also their photographs. A photo album, updated by the caregivers, allows mom to have the most recent pictures of family members and events and, when in slideshow mode, does not obscure the scrolling messages nor the main menu bars. These VITACARE features enable families and professional caregivers to create and maintain a simple yet effective communications environment to assist seniors in their daily lives independently.VITACARE will remain on and functional as long as the iPad is powered. We recommend a dock, available from Apple, to support and power the iPad. If, at any time, the battery level drops below 20% on the iPad, a message is sent automatically to the caregiver.Adapted LivingTM is a unique resource having assembled a comprehensive set of best-practice information from sources around the world. This information is focused on helping seniors remain in their own homes as they age and face inevitable limitations.";"VitaCare, emAPPetizer Inc., Health & Fitness, Medical, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"1.5.2";17;"English";550115997;"emappetizer Inc.";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/emappetizer-inc/id550115997?mt=8";9,99;"$";29,6;"2015-12-03";"2012-08-17";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;"2018-10-25";1;0;NA;NA;NA

It was designed to make you healthier and feel better. Vitamin D plays a huge role in our overall health, yet nearly 70% of people have low vitamin D which can lead to many other health issues. Most people should be taking vitamin D, but it isnt that simple!  Some people with low vitamin D should avoid taking vitamin D because a serious medical problem is present that caused the low vitamin D. Sound confusing?  No worries, this app will help you make the right decisions. It will analyze and graph all aspects of your vitamin D and calcium health and make personalized recommendations specifically for you. Although most people have low vitamin D because of lack of sun exposure, some people have other medical problems that caused the low vitamin D and thus the treatment is very different. Therefore, everybody with a low vitamin D must know WHY they have low vitamin D before they take vitamin D. Our expert doctors made this app because most doctors diagnose vitamin D problems incorrectly. Often patients are put on vitamin D without their doctor ever testing for other problems that may be present and life threatening. This is a medical app that can make you feel better and potentially save your life. However, it is easy to use and makes learning fun!The app was designed to be used by patients, but many doctors use it in their practice as well. Easy to use data entry forms result in beautiful graphs that make complex medical issues easy to understand and decisions about how to move forward easy. The Learning Library has easy to read articles written by expert doctors. The store will make specific vitamin D and calcium recommendations for you based upon your blood tests and analysis. Almost all users of the app will understand vitamin D problems better than their doctors, but it will help you discuss these issues with your doctors so you can come up the perfect plan for you. We will help you and your doctor take the guess work out of vitamin D and calcium problems.Low vitamin D is the number one diagnosed disease for the past 5 years. Many health issues (possibly even cancer) can be caused by low vitamin D.  If you take vitamin D or if you want to be as healthy as you can, then you need this app.FEATURES Analyzes and graphs current vitamin D levels Graphs all vitamin D levels over time to see trends Calculates your overall vitamin D health Analyzes your overall calcium health Analyzes and graphs vitamin D vs. calcium Analyzes and graphs calcium vs. parathyroid hormone Analyzes your parathyroid gland function Calculates and graphs chance of primary hyperparathyroidism Calculates and graphs chance of secondary hyperparathyroidism Calculates and graphs chance of pure vitamin D deficiency Analyzes and graphs bone density and osteoporosis Graphs bone density (osteoporosis) over time to see trends Teaches you how to interpret your data and graphs Gives personalized suggestions for next steps Suggests what new blood tests may be necessary Gives topics to discuss with your doctor Suggests vitamin D products personalized to your data Link to Amazon store for vitamin D products just for you Learning Center has dozens of excellent articles Made by doctors who are experts in vitamin D / calcium";"Vitamin-D Pro, Calcium Science, Medical, Health & Fitness, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"1.1.1";12;"English";587386616;"Calcium Science, LLC";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/calcium-science/id587386616?mt=8";1,99;"$";33,3;"2018-07-13";"2014-01-17";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;"2018-10-25";1;0;"Endocrinology";"Oncology";NA

Anyone who lives alone can suddenly be struck by health problems such as a heart attack, stroke, epilepsy or diabetes and find themselves in a helpless situation.  Moreover, accidents at home, such as slipping in the bathroom or falling down the stairs, cause many casualties and can happen to anyone of any age.What is it worth to you to increase the chance of receiving help in such a situation? How it worksVivalert is a smartphone app that gives you the choice of briefly checking-in once or several times a day. If you miss the reporting time, the app concludes that there is a problem. After a brief interval a message is sent to one or more designated contact persons. This can either be a family member, a neighbour, a friend or somebody from a social care organisation.It is not necessary for this contact person to own a smartphone. Any phone that can receive text messages is suitable.Target groupVivalert is a must for anyone living alone but especially for people suffering from an affliction such as epilepsy, diabetes or an allergy, all of which can suddenly worsen dramatically. These situations can become life threatening and timely assistance can save lives.Take the testIf you live alone and if something were to happen to you, how long would it take before you were missed and before anybody actively tried to make contact with you? If that is more than one day, then Vivalert might be a life-saver. PrivacyVivalert fully guarantees your privacy. You will never be tracked or traced. You, so to speak, keep an eye on yourself. All is well with you as long as your contact persons receive no news. Peace of mindVivalert is neither game nor gimmick but a tool. When used seriously and consistently it ensures the peace of mind of knowing that you can count on help in an emergency.By spending a small amount once, you strongly increase the chance of receiving help in situations in which you are no longer capable of making contact with the outside world. PracticalYou can set a maximum of three reporting times per day and as you please switch the app on and off on any day of the week. Of course you can also switch off Vivalert entirely.You can report to Vivalert an hour before the set time. For a reporting time of, for example, 1 p.m. you can notify Vivalert from 12 noon by pressing the button.If you fail to press the button within the agreed hour, then Vivalert gives you another fifteen minutes to do so. If you do not respond by pressing the button, then Vivalert assumes that there is a problem and a text message and email will be sent to your designated contact persons.The use of this app requires a certain discipline. Repeated false alarms will cause unnecessary concern to your contact persons and may affect their motivation.";"Vivalert, Slik, Health & Fitness, Medical, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"1.0.5";17;"English";979211833;"Slik BV";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/slik/id979211833?mt=8";5,99;"$";5,9;"2016-05-25";"2015-04-07";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;"2018-10-25";1;0;"DiabetesCare";"Cardiology";"Endocrinology"

During flu-season, community clinics and emergency rooms are often overcrowded, and it is difficult to know quickly how individual patients are doing.This mobile application allows healthcare professionals to assess patients quickly, at the point of care. Following simple yes/no questions, the app will automatically calculate two scores that may assist in patient management: the ViVI Disease Severity Score and the ViVI Risk Factor Score. This clinical decision support software helps doctors to take medical decisions quickly and to communicate consistently with patients and colleagues, using a shared language based on scientific evidence.The ViVI Score Mobile App can be used to score disease severity and risk in patients with influenza-like illness and/or other forms of acute respiratory infections (e.g. RSV, adenovirus metapneumovirus, rhinovirus and other respiratory viral pathogens), including in infants and children. It is specifically designed to improve workflow and quality of care - to the benefit of patients and their families. To this end, it was developed based on the principles of Design Thinking. The ViVI Score Mobile App can be used in anonymous, HIPAA cleared expedited mode - or in follow-up mode during IRB-approved clinical trials or observational studies. It can also be used to link standardized disease severity data to laboratory results.The ViVI Score Mobile App was developed by the Vienna Vaccine Safety Initiative (ViVI) a scientific think tank and international non-profit organization (www.vi-vi.org). It was tested and validated in extensive quality improvement programs in collaboration with medical universities and public health agencies.

Indeed, the clinician could use this information to personalize decisions regarding upfront surgical cytoreduction versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The aim of our model is to develop and validate a simple adjusted laparoscopic score to predict major postoperative complications after primary debulking surgery (PDS) in AEOC.To obtain a simple and easily applicable pre-operative score, the number of potential predictorswas a priori restricted to the parameters with the best performance (p less than 0.2) at multivariate analysis. Overlapping factors were removed based on their strong correlation and subsequent overfitting risk. The study population was randomly divided in a derivation group (n = 370) representing two-thirds of overall patients, and in a validation group (n= 185). The multivariate model to predict major complications was developed in the derivation group. The regression coefficients of the predictive parameters were shrunk by the calculated constant shrinkage factor (0.94) and then transformed the results into simple points. The mean risk for each point was calculated, and a scale to associate the predicted risk to each score was developed. Significant predictors included in the scoring system were: poor performance status, presence of ascites (N greater than 500 cm3), CA125 serum level (N greater than 1000 U/ml), and high laparoscopic tumor load (predictive index value, PIV=8). The sum of each value for each variable made the overall predictive risk score, which ranged between 0 and 8.  Then, the score and the predicted risk were computed for each patient in the validation population, and these new variables were tested using the c-statistic and the HosmerLemeshow test. Since our model was developed and validated on the same data, the performance could be too optimistic. However, to correct for the optimism in discriminative ability, the steps taken into Cox regression were internally validated by 200 random bootstrap samples and a subsequent correction for optimism in the c-statistic was performed. Moreover, since the model reflects a continuum of risk assessment, women were equally categorized a priori into three different classes: high risk group for score between 6 and 8, intermediate risk group for score between 3 and 5, and low risk group for score between 0 and 2. The prediction of risk of major complications using the score as progressive values is:2.2% for score 03.5% for score 15.4% for score 28.4% for score 312.7% for score 418.7% for score 526.7% for score 636.7% for score 747.9% for score 8The mean risk of developing major postoperative complications was 3.7%, 13.2% and 37.1% for low risk group, intermediate risk group and high risk group, respectively. To make more user-friendly this model, we have thought to develop an application for mobile devices. Indeed, despite the accuracy of internal validation by using a randomly selected 33% of the study cohort, a limitation of our model is the lack of validation in other centers and healthcare systems, which is a prerequisite for large-scale adoption of this score. In this context, although we acknowledge that laparoscopy is not adopted in many international centers, our results increase its indications and call for a larger use as valuable diagnostic tool in AEOC. Moreover, this application for mobile devices increase its reproducibility. Lastly, through this app, the surgeon may accurately and easily predict a patient's postoperative outcome with an early identification of high-risk woman, thus adopting tailored strategies on individual basis. * Vizzielli G, et al.

Had to call your Surgical registrar during surgery to check if a patient can eat? Called your Med Reg for the fifth time that day just to see what medications your patient goes home on? Then Ward Helper is for you!Designed by Junior Doctors for their colleagues, Ward Helper contains an easy checklist of things you should know before starting the ward round in the morning or ask to have clarified on the round. Perfect for those starting a new rotation, covering on relief or just looking to smooth out a fast paced ward round. Too busy to use it yourself? Why not have one of your student on the checklist to make sure nothing is missed? Students may also enjoy the list of commonly asked ward round questionsBased on research from the UK where introduction of FRIDAYS checklists created significant savings in time and man power.Whilst the authors have put in these items as the most important and most commonly required to know, it is impossible to cover the specifics of every patient.

First it reviews the latest recommendations on indications, INR targets, and treatment duration from the American College of Chest Physicians 8th Edition guidelines on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy from 2008, updated for the 2012 guideline.  Second it offers a protocol for Warfarin dose adjustment depending upon INR result.  And third is a discussion of protocols for the initiation of Warfarin.  These resources come from point of care guides on these topics in the family medicine literature as well as the 2012 ACCP guideline.  The app also alludes to guidance for management of peri-operative Warfarin by directing the user to our PreOpEval iPhone app.The app addresses such common questions as: how long do I treat with Warfarin after a first DVT? which artificial heart valves require that higher level of anticoagulation? how do I respond to an INR of 7.4? this pt needs Warfarin, how do I get it started? how long do I anticoagulate with Warfarin for A-fib before a planned cardioversion attempt? when do I give Vitamin K to reverse Warfarin anticoagulation and at what dose??This app is written and intended for practicing clinicians involved in Warfarin anticoagulation such as internists, cardiologists, family physicians, nurses, pharmacists, PA's and NP's; for resident physician trainees; and for medical students.

He performed the first laparoscopic gastric bypass in the world as primary surgeon in 1993. This was performed right here in San Diego, California. Dr Wittgrove is board certified in general surgery and is a Fellow of the American Society of Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery. He served 10 years as a  Navy  surgeon and has been performing bariatric surgery since he set up private practice in San Diego in 1986. Since the mid 1990s he has been practicing bariatric surgery in the setting of a multi-disciplinary team approach. Dr. Wittgrove is the past president of the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS) serving in 2003  2004.Tracy Martinez RN, BSN, CBN, is our program director. She oversees all aspects of our program and our multidisciplinary team who provide support before and after surgery. She is dedicated to help every patient optimize their health and well-being. Tracy was the first elected president of Integrated Health Section of the ASMBS from 2000  2004. She is currently the chair of the International Society Integrated Health (IFSO). In addition, Tracy is a proud to serve on the Obesity Action Coalition (OAC). The OAC is a nonprofit organization dedicated to help individuals affected by excess weight-related health conditions through education and advocacy. Tracy is a certified Perfect Health Instructor at the Chopra Center in Carlsbad California. This has helped her bring a holistic aspect of care in helping patients achieve health and balance in their life. Dr. Wittgrove and Wittgrove Bariatric Center have significant experience in Bariatric Surgery on the Adolescent Patient and Revision Bariatric Surgery. Dr. Wittgrove was a primary investigator for the LapBand System. We have added sections on all these specialties through the tabs above.A 2009 addition to our clinic is our Medical Weight Loss Program. Surgery is a powerful tool, but it is not for everyone. Some insurance programs require a medical program before surgery can be considered. Millions of individuals suffer from Obesity (BMI less than 35) and surgery is not an option for them at this time. Many in this category need help and so we offer a comprehensive, multidisciplinary, medical program. Call the office to ask about this aspect of our program.Few programs have evaluated their long-term outcomes as Dr. Wittgrove has. In fact, few programs have outcomes for longer than even a couple of years. In Bariatric Surgery, we know that results at one or two years are nice to know but the real important numbers are those at five years and longer. We have added our programs data, which has been reported / published in peer reviewed journals and presented at annual society conferences. Since we believe outcomes and longer-term results are important, we have added a section on some questions we think you should ask of your bariatric surgeon.Wittgrove Bariatric Center is a Certified Accredited Center by the American Society for Metabolic and bariatric Surgery and the American College of Surgeons in partnership with Scripps Memorial Hospital. Our program has significant experience from all aspects of care! We provide Bariatric and Metabolic Surgery (weight loss surgery), medical weight loss, long-term follow up, back on track consultations, and monthly support groups.";"WBC Support, Wittgrove Bariatric Center, Health & Fitness, Lifestyle, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"1.01.01";4;"English, Dutch, French, German, Italian";1412850273;"Alvarado Surgical Associates,A Medical Group Inc";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/wittgrove-bariatric-center/id1412850273?mt=8";0;NA;27,2;"2018-09-02";"2018-07-31";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;"2018-10-25";1;0;"Surgery";"MentalHealth&Neurology";"Nutrition"

WebMAP Mobile is designed to help teens cope with pain and increase their ability to do things that are important to them.In this program, you will learn different behavioral and cognitive skills for managing pain and for doing more activities that you want to do. You are going to be traveling through awesome destinations during the program. It takes about 6 weeks or so to go through all of the destinations; however, you can use this app and the skills recommended for as long as you need to. Each of the places that you visit will teach different skills to help you manage your pain. You will also keep track of your symptoms and progress, and complete assignments to help you practice new skills. You will work on each assignment for a few days before you move onto the next place. Who created it?WebMAP Mobile was created by Dr. Tonya Palermo and her team at the Seattle Childrens Research Institute. The team is composed of health professionals and researchers with experience in e-health treatments for pain in youth. The software was developed by 2Morrow, Inc. a company specialized in mobile behavior change interventions. The contents of the program have been adapted from a successful online pain treatment program called WebMAP, which stands for Web-based Management of Adolescent Pain, which teens could access on a computer through the internet.

There are various theories, such as an atmospheric pressure theory (it was due to low atmospheric pressure), a light intensity theory (it was due to the sky being dark and cloudy), and a sound theory (it was due to the sound of rain being close to an f/1 tremor).We decided to focus on the sound theory and added a feature, to a basic alarm clock app that plays sleeping music, such as the sound of rain.From this, a total coverage alarm clock app, that can both smoothly lead you off to sleep and wake you from your slumber, was born.NOTES:- There is a possibility that the alarm may not ring at the set time under the following circumstances:* The device is set to silent mode* The device is set to Do Not Disturb mode* Notifications from this app have been disabled- If you are unable to find the music you would like to play within our app, the cause is likely that the music exists within the iCloud but has not yet been downloaded to the device.In that case, start up the standard music app and download the music to the device.

Psychologists, psychiatrists, therapists, or counselors use WeFeel to enhance their current toolbox to make therapy more effective. Unlike other mental health apps, WeFeel is not designed to replace therapy, but to help you be your best. What is WeFeel? WeFeel is a set of mobile tools to replace proven traditional pen and paper techniques used by therapists worldwide: emotion tracking, mood journaling, traditional journaling, goals, coping strategies, and medication lists. WeFeel tracks Anger, Love, Joy, Fear, Disgust, Sorrow, Stress, and Outlook by default, and up to 6 custom items with a subscription. WeFeel supercharges traditional techniques by adding data visualizations and the ability to filter by location, social situation and activity. You can identify causes and stressors to help bring about change.WeFeel summarizes key discussion topics, eliminating the nothing much answer to What has been going since we met last? Therapists and individuals find patterns that have been missed so they effectively work on core issues. WeFeels emotion tracking prompts both randomly or on a schedule to track core emotions, stress, outlook, situation, location and activity. Add custom items (with a subscription) and completely control what you want to track. For younger or developmentally challenged patients simplify what is displayed down to just core emotions to help them recognize and identify how they feel. Custom items can help track things like urges to relapse, to help treat addiction, track how manic or depressive someone is feeling to treat bi-polar disorder, or treat depression and anxiety by finding correlation between time of day, location, situation and activities. You can add coping strategies to each item you track, and then WeFeel automatically reminds you of the strategy when your entry matches it. For example, when you feel angry you can be reminded to pause and count to ten. With a subscription mood, and emotion data can be shared. It is helpful to share between patient and care provider, between patients for couples therapy, or between a child and a parent. For couples, this greatly enhances understanding, and provides insight into a partners needs. For psychologists, psychiatrists, therapists, and counselors you can monitor your patients in real time. This is especially useful for those going through rehab/addiction treatment. Who is using WeFeel and how is that data kept safe? WeFeel is used by hundreds of people across 30 countries. You might be concerned by the lack of reviews; unfortunately, there is still stigma around mental health issues and reviews arent anonymous. While we encourage people to help end the stigma by reviewing WeFeel, it was designed from the ground up to be an anonymous service. This helps with HIPAA compliance (something we take seriously) and means we cannot individually identify those who use WeFeel. We dont store users email address, contact or payment info. For examples of how it is used please check out www.wefeel.us Getting started: The biggest hurdle to getting the benefits of WeFeel is building a habit to use it. The app itself will help you with this. A tutorial gets you started and reminder prompts help you create emotion entries. The more data WeFeel has, the more it can help.As you consistently enter emotions there will be a moment of clarity where you find insight that would have been missed. With that clarity, breakthroughs occur, new conversations can be had, paths to better emotional health open up, and change for the better can begin. That moment is the reason we created WeFeel.

Your diet will never be the same.The Details:We developed this weight loss tool in response to a difficult dieting reality:  Keeping track of what you eat is tedious and time consuming... However, tracking food consumption is proven to help dieters lose twice as much weight.*  Unfortunately most people think tracking their diet means counting calories. They try to figure out the exact number of calories in a sandwich how many calories in each slice of cheese?  How much mayonnaise?  What type of bread? Etc  If you're trying to do the math for everything you eat every time you eat, please use one of the many other wonderful calorie counting apps available.  But the reality is... Counting calories is too hard (and unrealistic) over the long run. Our solution is far more elegant and effective: A Photo Food Diary.  Photo Food Diaries provide the key benefits of food tracking (Awareness and Accountability) without wasting your time!AWARENESS: Lets face it we eat a lot (and for the wrong reasons).  We eat when were bored, when were being social, when were not hungry!  AND when we eat for the right reasons we tend to eat MORE than we should.  A Photo Food Diary brings Awareness into our dietary lives without all of the tedious counting.  Food tracking is about Awareness, NOT counting.  How much did you eat yesterday?  Were certain your food diary will surprise you! ACCOUNTABILITY: Once you gain the mindset that youll be snapping a picture of everything BEFORE you eat it, your food decisions improve. Id really like chili cheese fries right now but Ill need to snap a photo first. Then Ill have to stare at a picture of my bad food decision next time I open my diary. Over time, better eating habits are formed and weight comes off!Weight Snap Features:- Super fast meal snapping - Note taking capabilities for each snap- Meal ratings - Rate your meal red, yellow or green in accordance with your diet (honesty required!).- Email capabilities: Send your trainer, doctor, or dietician your weekly meal summary- Track your BMI, Body Fat %, Weight, Waist Size, Chest Size, and Hip Size- Intuitive graphing to evaluate progress- Ability to set a target weight and see how youre performing against it (Goals Are Good!)- The capability to set a target date to focus your weight loss efforts (Deadlines Are Good!)- Custom body measurement tracking - No website to join - No data or wireless required - No membership required-Get Started with Weight Snap- *Learn more on our website: www.weightsnap.com";"Weight Snap - Personal Fitness, Health And Weight Tracking Diary, Lawton LLC, Health & Fitness, Medical, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"3.0";4;"English, Catalan, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian Bokmål, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Simplified Chinese, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish, Traditional Chinese, Turkish";979797707;"Lawton LLC";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/lawton-llc/id979797707?mt=8";0,99;"$";12,8;"2015-11-06";"2012-09-15";4,3;7;57;0;29;14;0;"2018-10-25";1;0;"Nutrition";NA;NA

Your diet will never be the same.The Details:We developed this weight loss tool in response to a difficult dieting reality: Keeping track of what you eat is tedious and time consuming... However, tracking food consumption is proven to help dieters lose twice as much weight.* Unfortunately most people think tracking their diet means counting calories. They try to figure out the exact number of calories in a sandwich how many calories in each slice of cheese? How much mayonnaise? What type of bread? Ugh!!If you're trying to do the math for everything you eat every time you eat, please use one of the many other wonderful calorie counting apps available. But the reality is... Counting calories is too hard (and unrealistic) over the long run.Our solution is far more elegant and effective: A Photo Food Diary. Photo Food Diaries provide the key benefits of food tracking (Awareness and Accountability) without wasting your time!AWARENESS: Lets face it we eat a lot (and for the wrong reasons). We eat when were bored, when were being social, when were not hungry! AND when we eat for the right reasons we tend to eat MORE than we should.

KYND BODY gives you a score on what you look like on the inside, your blood results, cholesterol, HBAIC for prediabetes, Blood pressure, lung function and other personalised tests. These variables not only how determine how long you live, but how WELL you live. KYND MIND gives you a score on how you think and feel. Using tools such as Healthy Thinking you can check your Mind, and improve how it operates. We are given this MIND but no manual on how to operate it or improve it so it serves you well. Having a KYND Mind will equip you better in life and help you be more successful at work, home and the community. The more people in your workplace have a KYND mind, the more engaged and successful you will be.KYND LIFE is a way of life.

Social media is their comfort zone and where many go first, rightly or wrongly, for all their answers. If teens need or are willing to accept support or counselling for any problem, large or small, we believe many will choose social media before more traditional resources. To use our app: 1: Download. 2: Open the app. 3: Choose ""Start"" on the main screen.3: Hover your phone or tablet over our print materials to see them come to life. Look for marketing pieces that say ""Interactive"" on it. Don't have one of our prints? No Problem.

Noise signal relative, other do not have this property are called colored noise. Ideal white noise has infinite bandwidth, so its energy is infinite, which is impossible in the real world exists. In fact, we often limited bandwidth of the signal level regarded as white noise, because it makes us more convenient in mathematical analysis. However, the white noise in the mathematical treatment is more convenient, so it is a powerful tool for system analysis. In general, as long as the spectral width of a noise process has the effect that it is much larger than the bandwidth of the system, and its spectral density can basically be considered as a constant in the bandwidth, you can use it as white noise to deal with. For example, thermal noise and shot noise over a wide frequency range with a uniform power spectral density can usually think they are white noise. When you need to concentrate on work, there is always a complex and surrounding sound, you can use these two sounds to be obscured. In general, under normal circumstances you can use the white noise, pink noise is specifically for voice masking material. Pink noise has been known frequency is inversely proportional to (1 / f) noise, because its energy is inversely proportional to the frequency distribution, or every octave (Octave) the energy recession 3dB.One application is the white noise of architectural acoustics, in order to weaken the internal space distracting and do not want the noise (such as conversation human) appears, use continuous low-intensity noise as background sound. Some sirens of emergency vehicles also use white noise as white noise to pass through cities such as background noise and traffic noise does not cause reflections, it is easier to attract attention. In electronic music also applied white noise, which is directly or as the input signal of the filter to produce other types of noise signals, especially in audio synthesis, often like cymbals for reproducing a high frequency domain so that percussion noise components. White noise is used to generate the impulse response. In order to ensure a balanced effect Venue concerts or other performances, it issued a white noise or pink noise from the PA system instantly, and in a different place to monitor the noise signal, so that engineers can effect a building acoustics can automatically enlarge or cut certain frequencies, which can be adjusted to give effect overall balance a balanced harmony. White noise can be used for frequency response of the filter amplifier or electronic test, sometimes it is used with a flat response microphone or automatic equalizer.";"White Noise 3D - Nature Music Hypnotic Lullaby, Sihui Yu, Medical, Productivity, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"1.1.0";4;"English, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese";1079388451;"Sihui Yu";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/sihui-yu/id1079388451?mt=8";0;NA;38,1;"2016-10-21";"2016-03-14";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;"2018-10-25";1;0;"EmergencyMedicine";"SensorySystemsHealthcare";"Nutrition"

I'm not a great sleeper so I was dreading this aspect of parenthood. My sister had issues getting her first born to sleep until she discovered a video called Happiest Baby On the Block. Check it out - it's fantastic. One of the things Dr. Karp recommends is white noise. You can shush loudly, buy all sorts of machines, tune a radio to in between stations, download a white noise audio clip to your phone ... or now you can use the super-simple and easy-to-use White Noise app.So why would you use white noise?- White noise reduces stress in babies. White noise helps babies block out all that new stimulation.- White noise helps babies fall asleep more easily and stay asleep longer. Babies have sleep arousals generally every 20-45 minutes. White noise helps babies get through these arousals fall back into deeper sleep.- White noise helps babies cry less. Why do you shush a baby when they are crying? It works (sometimes). Shushing is your personal white noise generator.- White noise may reduce the risk of SIDS. A study found that babies had a significant reduction in the risk of SIDS if there was a fan in their room. No one knows exactly why this happens but many believe it's due to the white noise a fan makes. We do know that white noise reduces active sleep (which is the type of sleep where SIDS is most likely to occur).- White noise will help parents sleep. Who knew babies were sound loud sleepers? White noise will help mask the grunts, gurgles and farts (the noise, not the smell) so you can sleep better. You can still here them if they cry.- It's easy to wean babies off the sound. It is suggested you do this around the 1 year mark by slowly decreasing the volume.There has been quite a few articles and studies on white noise machines being too loud and damaging a babies hearing. The rule-of-thumb is that it should be as loud as a shower (if you are standing next to it, not under it). With the White Noise app you simply turn the volume on your phone up and down until it is an appropriate level.There are a few other apps available that allow you to play white noise but they all have confusing play controls, too many options (your baby does not want to listen to a thunderstorm), show ads all over the place, and generally don't look good. The White Noise app does one thing - you open the app and it starts playing (there is a timer but you don't have to set that).So now my little guy is 8 weeks old and I'm getting more sleep than before he arrived. He is a great little sleeper. Is it the white noise or is it luck? I suspect it is a bit of both but I suggest you try using white noise. I built this app for my wife an I but I am sure many others will find it super useful. I hope you like it.

The report compares you to others of the same gender and age group. It estimates your level on each of the five broad personality domains of the Five-Factor Model. The description of each one of the five broad domains is followed by a more detailed description of personality according to the six subdomains that comprise each domain.Although it uses complex calculations to normalize the results based on the users age and gender, the app is designed to be simple and easy to use. Reports are saved so they can be reviewed later. This allows you to compare your results in different circumstances or over time, or to compare your results with how someone else might view you. Reports can also be shared via message or email.All responses to this quiz are completely confidential. There are two versions of the quiz: a short version and a long version. Both measure the same traits. The long version will provide somewhat more valid results than the shorter version. The short version includes 120 items, and most people complete it in 10  20 minutes.

The European health report 2015 describes the health situation of the European Region and progress towards the targets of WHOs Health 2020 policy. The app presents Health 2020 core indicators, which were agreed by the WHO European Region Member States for monitoring progress towards the Health 2020 targets.

Data from WHO sources can be accessed and queried at national level, while data from non-WHO sources is available in aggregated form, for groups of Member States. The 6th international report from the WHO collaborative study - the Health Behavior in School-aged Children survey (HBSC)   published in 2016 presents the 11-, 13- and 15-year-old boys' and girls' health and well-being, social environments and health behaviors, as well as the health inequalities many of them face.

Determine what percentile they are on and if they are slipping, cruising or going over their expected growth trend. Every doctor's office uses this same chart system to ensure your baby/child/teen is growing normally.What do these charts look like, and what do they show? ===========================================Parents, caregivers and health workers around the world are familiar with growth references. They are the values of weight and height for each age against which they measure the growth of the children under their care. The current references do not indicate how children should grow for the best health outcome, however, rather they simply describe how the average child grows.  The WHO Child Growth Standards go beyond the current references. They allow important growth measurements, such as body weight and length/height of infants and children to be assessed against a standard optimum value. There are charts for boys and for girls, and for infants to one year, and for children up to five years.  These measurements are important indicators of health and help determine whether a child or a population of children is healthy and growing well. For example, children who are short for their age (below the red line on the length/height chart) or underweight (below the red line on the weight chart) indicate that their health may be compromised - the further from the red lines, the more indicative of a health problem. In clinical practice, these measurements help with early diagnosis of illness and help monitor progress during treatment.  Importantly, for the first time there now exist standardized Body Mass Index - BMI - charts for infants to age five, which is particularly useful for monitoring the increasing epidemic of childhood obesity.

Low- and middle-income countries already bear over 85% of the burden of these premature deaths.

When paired with a WHOOP Strap, the WHOOP App provides physiological data, analysis, and actionable insights that help athletes tailor their training, improve their sleep, and maximize their performance.For a coach or trainer, it provides the ability to see every member of a team in a list and their respective Strain Scores after a workout or game, their Recoveries in the morning (how prepared they are for strain/exercise), and their Sleep Performance last night. This helps prevent overtraining/undertraining, optimize lineups and rotations, improve training plans, and increase team accountability.Strain Feedback:The WHOOP Strap doesnt measure steps - it measures strain.  The WHOOP App downloads data from the WHOOP Strap and uploads it to WHOOPs servers.*  The app allows athletes to see the strain of their workouts, providing information on the strain their bodies accrue during the physical activities.  The app also allows athletes to track running and cycling routes, offering a map of the completed route and data on distance and speed.Sleep Performance vs Sleep Need:WHOOP offers athletes a sleep score, which is based on the time an athlete sleeps each night and a personalized calculation of the hours of sleep the athlete requires.  Both calculations are based on the data coming from the WHOOP Strap, coupled with WHOOPs proprietary analytics algorithms.  The app also displays further details on each sleep, including the time spent in each sleep stage, the time it takes to fall asleep, and the number of disturbances during the night.Quantified Recovery:WHOOP lets athletes know how prepared their bodies are for physical strain and exertion.  The Recovery score offered by the app is calculated after each sleep and is based on physiological data coming from the WHOOP Strap.Team Interface:If you join WHOOP as a team, the WHOOP app allows you to see the Strain and Recovery scores of your teammates.  This allows athletes to compare their daily Intensities and Recoveries against their fellow team members. For a coach or trainer, it provides the ability to see every member of a team in a list and their respective Strain Scores after a workout or game, their Recoveries in the morning (how prepared they are for strain/exercise), and their Sleep Performance last night. This helps prevent overtraining/undertraining, optimize lineups and rotations, improve training plans, and increase team accountability.* Continued use of GPS and Bluetooth running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.";"WHOOP Performance Optimization, WHOOP, Health & Fitness, Sports, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"1.8.6";4;"English";933944388;"Whoop Incorporated";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/whoop/id933944388?mt=8";0;NA;63,7;"2018-10-19";"2016-09-30";3,7;60;58;8;3;7;23;"2018-10-25";1;0;"SleepAndRespiratoryCare";NA;NA

However, in a recent study, 55 to 90% of the sexual health sites consisted wrong or misleading information.CDC estimates that nearly 20 million new sexually transmitted infections occur every year in USA and with half among young people aged 1524. Most of the STD cases (50-80%) dont have any symptoms at all or the signs are so mild that you may not notice.There is strong evidence that young people who receive good quality sex and relationship education (SRE) programs that start early are more likely to first have sex at an older age, to have fewer sexual partners and to use contraception.All these underscore how important it is to make sure there is accurate, appropriate and easily accessible information available to teens, because it is used and acted upon.Wiki1001 app is also an indispensable source for parents to debunk potentially uncomfortable discussions with their children concerning sex.Therefore, we, as two physicians, want to stand up with this app for you, to be more than a doctor, the web, your friends and family added together.

We truly believe that you can Practice Smarter, which allows you to Avoid Burnout, Make More, Work Less, and Start Enjoying Practice Again.  Why?  Because You Deserve It!Winning Dentist Magazine provides the tools and strategies for Dentists to achieve higher practice production and collections, and also lifestyle and professional balance that creates peace of mind. Subscribe today!There is no doubt that things are trending in a way that presents a set of challenges and new opportunities to the Solo Private Practitioner. It seems that if you are not pondering starting your own dental chain or joining a dental corporation these days, you are certainly in the minority. Regardless of perception, the Solo, General Practitioner in America is still very much in the minority, albeit a silent one. Winning Dentist Magazine came about in a unique way. At the very core it is an outcrop of the duplicities I have personally observed ever since starting my coaching practice back in 2008.Solo Private Dentists routinely fall into the traps of trying to be two things at once:   - Daily they are both caregivers and bosses.   - They are businessmen and family men.   - They are husband and healer.Far too often we fall victim to allowing the pendulum of balance swing too far in one direction or the other. In my opinion, a Winning Dentist is one who understands their unique role in the universe without letting it take every ounce of energy they have, which could be better used to enrich the world. There are dentists out there who are struggling and need a bit of a lifeline. There are dentists who nearly have it figured out, but lack one small piece of the puzzle to really take life by the horns. Then, there are the dentists who seem to effortlessly glide through the pitfalls and trials of professional life that ensnare so many. These dentists lead a life, not to be envied by the small minded, but to be celebrated and looked upon as a model for others to aspire.Winning Dentist Magazine will inspire the reader to be introspective about their own lives and to free their minds to the possibilities of a balanced life, well-lived. There is not one way to this life. In fact, the ways in which you can become your own Winning Dentist are limitless.It is my hope that you begin that journey today and I hope that this publication helps in some small way.Chris Griffin DDSPublisherhttp://thecapacityacademy.com/the-winning-dentist-magazine-terms-of-service";"Winning Dentist Magazine - Practice Smarter, Effective Dentistry, LLC, Medical, Magazines & Newspapers, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"7.8.3";12;"English, Danish, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Thai";549723602;"Effective Dentistry, LLC";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/effective-dentistry-llc/id549723602?mt=8";0;NA;33,3;"2017-03-06";"2012-12-26";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;"2018-10-25";1;0;"Dentistry";"GinecologyAndObstetrics";"SensorySystemsHealthcare"

Simply type in your word, prayer, affirmation or mantra and our sophisticated process will convert this text to a Cosmic Healing Sound. Click play and listen to the tones to experience your words as a healing tool!Words that heal use a sophisticated process called archetypal encoding that translates an Experience (words as an example) into a set of Audio Symbols (Cosmic Healing Sounds)The more relaxed you are, the more your consciousness can receive the sound stimulation and then decode this information at a non intellectual level. Ever wondered how we get a message from music without being able to put it into words or even hear the lyrics in the first place? It is simply a different kind of knowing.Cosmic Sounds have an innate potency when combined with Consciousness.Words carry immeasurable significance: The universe was created with a word; Jesus healed and cast out demons with a word; rulers have risen and fallen by their words; The Shabda Brahman is the transcendental sound described in the Vedic Scriptures and serves as the basis for many classes of mantra, hymns and prayers.  In Tantric concepts, the sound in its primary stage is a psychic vibration or vibrating modulation of Consciousness.  The experience of Sound is the perception of this vibration in Consciousness.  Sound as a Symbol is the entanglement of Meaning, Message, Memory, Motion and Matter.In Yogic Science, vowel sounds are considered expressions of the Shiva aspect of Reality and consonant sounds that of the Shakti.  In summary vowels are associated with Consciousness/Spirit and the consonants with Manifestation/Matter.Did You Know.In order for a consonant to be expressed, it needs a vowel.  In Archetype Encoding, the sound vibration characteristic of every vowel and consonant is coupled methodically with its parallel audial frequency.  In this way, each grouping of sounds acts as a creative force that manifests in Consciousness and transfer instantly to the energetic and material aspects of the body.  Architype Encoding is a technical design based on the very act of creation that permeates every moment of Life and Nature.Be Well, Enjoy with an open heart and FREE Your MindPurchase Details:$2.99 is a non consumable purchase which means once purchased, this will be for a lifetime purchase.Your iTunes Account will be charged $2.99 at the time of purchase.

The system can draw a coloured line on top of the image which you can view within three dimensions, including determining the depth or the amount that a point has raised.  It will allow the user to determine the circumference of what they are looking for, while comparing points.Straight Measurements: In order to obtain the straight line measurement you choose the picture of the ruler, this will also allow you to draw a line from point 1 to the finishing point.  Tap the screen where you wish for the start of the measurement to occur, then pan the camera to the finishing point and tap on the screen.Circumference Measurement: When choosing the circumference measurement, you start with the original point and choose each subsequent point you are looking for along the path of the wound.  When you reach the point that you are back at your original point choose the stop button and the system will auto calculate the measurements.Height Measurement: To choose this function you choose the human character with the arrow beside it, this will allow you to choose multiple points and change path directions and find out the total measurement of the path.Depth Measurement:  Depth uses two points in order to determine the depth of the wound.  Choose point one on the first side of the wound, then choose a second point on the opposite side of the wound which crosses over the point you wish to determine the depth of.  The system will then check the physical depth of each point long the wound and advise of the greatest depth along the path.";"Wound Care Assistant, Bradley Birnie, Medical, Productivity, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"1.0.13";12;"English";1155845498;"Bradley Birnie";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/bradley-birnie/id1155845498?mt=8";2,99;"$";27,8;"2018-06-02";"2017-12-08";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;"2018-10-25";1;0;"Surgery";NA;NA

It is meant to replace the need for using unsanitary paper rulers and other unsanitary means of measuring the width, height, and depth of a wound on a patient or yourself. This saves you not only the cost of a separate measuring device each time a wound is measured, but also helps to reduce the chance of infection that can come from touching a measurement device to an open wound. With the Wound Measurement App, you can measure a wound opening one-handed, reducing some of the problems that can come with measuring a wound in a difficult spot. Once the measurements are complete, a label with appear over the wound with the measurements and you can save a picture of both the measurements and the opening all at the same time, saving you time and effort. We respect the privacy of our users and their patients. We cannot and will not access the camera or photos remotely. Please note that the app will need to be allowed to use your phones camera only to take the measurements, and it will need to be allowed to save a photo to the photos library. If you do not wish to keep a photo, you can always go to your photos library and delete anything you don't want to keep.Features List:-Simple to use, with easy access to instructions.-Easy, one-handed operation.-Augmented Reality, tested for accuracy.-Does not require internet or cellular connection to take measurements or save photos.-Sanitary - nothing touches the wound.-In poor lighting conditions, the flashlight can be turned on within the App.-Allows you to track the healing process easily and visually through photos saved from the App.Compatible with: iPhone Models: 6S, 6S Plus, 7, 7 Plus, SE, 8, 8 Plus, X, and later.iPad Models:iPad (2017 model), iPad Pro (9.7, 10.5, or 12.9) both first and second generation and later.For the best results in Augmented Reality, keep the phone perpendicular to the surface you want to measure, and for a more smooth AR experience, set the camera rate to 60fps or higher in settings (under the camera settings).";"Wound Measurement, Chase Lewis, Medical, Health & Fitness, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";NA;17;"English";1393857220;"Chase Lewis";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/chase-lewis/id1393857220?mt=8";0,99;"$";9,2;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;"2018-10-25";1;0;NA;NA;NA

Writing Therapy also has a built-in cueing hierarchy to give ""hints"" on each level, making the exercise one step easier to allow success on each trial. A virtual set of letter tiles makes therapy go faster with more repetitions in less time. You can add your own words and pictures to create completely customized spelling lists! Learn to spell names, places, or words related to each user's needs. This app features clear photographs, iconic graphics, and a clear male voice in 5 languages. Users will benefit from the trial-and-error format and self-selected cues for learning these common words with graduated activities that will grow with them as they develop or improve. Settings allow limiting the length of the words, selecting capital or lowercase letters, designating which of 12 categories are presented, and choosing how letters are selected. For users with difficulty dragging, an alternative tapping access method is available. Speech-Language Pathologists, family members, and teachers can recommend the appropriate modes and levels for each user and receive e-mailed reports of results (ready for professional progress notes). Writing Therapy is another powerful app in Tactus Therapy Solutions' professionally-designed Language Therapy suite of speech-language therapy apps. It is the perfect companion to Comprehension Therapy, Naming Therapy, and Reading Therapy. Our customers love this app! Read what they have to say: ""I really like that this app can be used by both children and adults. I love the great real-life photographs used instead of cartoon pictures or line drawings. The functional, categorized vocabulary you use in your apps is appreciated!! I especially like the feature allowing older students/clients the opportunity to analyze their responses prior to submitted them. This app has great control over the length of the words selected, the voice quality is good, and clinicians will appreciate the data reporting! Great job!"" ""Great app, highly engaging! I used this app with two of my aphasia clients- one in her 30s and one in his 50s. Both found it engaging and wanted to continue to use the app throughout their session. I like the different levels of difficulty and the hints (which both of my clients appreciated as well). Great app!"" ""Beautifully done! A child or an adult can use this; the very nice part is that it isn't childish as many learn to spell apps are, which I absolutely love. My favorite part is the fact that words can actually be misspelled which allows the user to decide for themselves if it is correct or not BEFORE hitting the check button. So the target word is actually learned rather than just swiping letters until they all go into the correct slot.

This study is one of the first to be designed with the assistance of Apple's ResearchKit software. With the Yale Cardiomyopathy Index app, eligible individuals contribute self-assessments of their Quality of Life across multiple domains and perform 6-minute walks to assess peak distance covered and heart rate trends. Educational resources to assist in understanding these conditions are available within the application. This study, approved by the Yale University Institutional Review Board, is the first to use ResearchKit and HealthKit to better understand the issues affecting children and young adults. With a parent or guardians permission and co-participation, children as young as 8 years of age provide an assessment of how their cardiomyopathy or their risk of developing a cardiomyopathy affects their daily lives. Parents of those 2 to 8 years of age can take part on their own with tailored questionnaires designed to assess how a cardiomyopathy affects their younger child. Adults between 18 and 80 years may take part on their own. Multiple people from the same family can take part simultaneously within this app.Quality of Life is the perceived quality of someones daily life. It can be influenced by many variables including presence of a medical condition or risk of developing an inheritable condition found within ones family. Cardiomyopathies are diverse diseases of the heart muscle which may adversely limit the ability of the heart to pump blood to the body and are present in as many as 1 in 500 individuals. Understanding how these conditions affect peoples day-to-day lives is of significant importance in treating patients.";"Yale Cardiomyopathy Index, Yale, Medical, Health & Fitness, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";NA;17;"English";462262997;"Yale University";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/yale/id462262997?mt=8";0;NA;67,9;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;"2018-10-25";1;0;"Cardiology";"Pediatrics";NA

Even though other disciplines can help to build strength, not all of them have the healing powers of yoga. This mobile application is specially designed to boost your health; improve your image, posture, flexibility, stamina, and metabolism; and alleviate stress along with chronic pain.Results are amazing!These are some ways in which your mind, body, and emotions change after practicing yoga:      1. Your level of happiness is incremented.      2. Stress disappears.      3. Your memory and learning speed is enhanced.      4. Depression is better treated.      5. The parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) is activated.      6. Your decision-making becomes faster and smarter.      7. Your self-esteem is boosted.      8. Your physical condition is improved.      9. Your strength is increased.      10. Your range of flexibility is widened.      11. Chronical pain is relieved.The main advantage of this application over others available in the yoga field lies in its highly specialized routines perfectly tailored to specific situations or physical aches and whose results are almost immediate. Its meditations reduce stress significantly and its original playlists foster a balance among mind, body, and soul. All its content can be easily navigated through a body map with shortcuts to lessons ranging from neck pain to insomnia treatment.The thematic tutorials, based on the restorative Hatha yoga modality, are illustrated with multimedia that can be practiced effortlessly and scheduled according to a built-in activity calendar that keeps track of user progress.Yoga covers a series of physical and mental activation exercises that provide a sense of general well-being. It also includes meditation practices, poses and harmonious movements involving concentration, relaxation, and breath control.Through this inner state of relaxation and control, new, improved skills start to flourish at all levels; we learn how to canalize our impulses, make better decisions, or build a healthier relationship with everything that surrounds us.The number of scientific studies that back up and evidence the benefits of yoga and meditation increases on a constant basis. These same benefits were discovered long ago by the first yogis (whose experience and legacy have built and shaped the discipline we know today).A recent survey showed that out of 300 yoga practitioners, 95% were convinced that yoga brings serenity to their lives, and 100% said they would recommend it to all their friends and relatives.The Harvard Medical School (HMS) was the first renowned institution to conduct a study on the benefits of yoga and was surprised by the results: meditation proved capable of not only reducing stress and relaxing, but also of, literally, changing the way brain works.Researchers analyzed the brain capacity in a sample of people who had been practicing meditation regularly for a couple of decades and found out that, in comparison to those who didnt, they showed better, improved conditions.Stressed out? Worn out? Out of balance? Do you have little to no time to join a yoga studio? Have you ever wondered how yoga can contribute to make your daily routine easier?Our videos are focused on easing everyday aches and achieving overall health in the short run through 3 different programs:      * Daily practice      * 2 times a week      * 3 times a weekYOGA HOMELINE is not a tangible space, its a state created by you anytime anywhere.";"Yoga Homeline, Jose Luis Mendez, Health & Fitness, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";NA;4;"English, Spanish";1120970315;"Jose Luis Mendez";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/jose-luis-mendez/id1120970315?mt=8";2,99;"$";35,2;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;"2018-10-25";1;0;"MentalHealth&Neurology";"Nutrition";"EmergencyMedicine"

There is no need to be tethered to your iPhone anymore.  YoNav! on the Apple Watch Series 2 & 3 is 100% stand alone for tracking and telemetry.  What sets YoNav! apart is the efficiency of data.  There is no clutter, no complicated menus, just a GPS app that works.  YoNav! is perfect for:--Sailing--Kiteboarding, surfing, or other water sports --Orienteering--OutdoorsmenUsing the latest features of the Apple Watch Series 2 & 3, YoNav! can:--Track and map your activity--Display important telemetry during your activity --Export your tracks to GPX format for use in most major navigation software--Keep track of your sailing starts with a built-in timer that offers haptic feedback during the countdown.--Track your calories burned during your activityTrack and map your activityYoNav! will track and map your activity (on iPhone) using color coded tracks to show speed variations.  Tracking can be turned on and off from the watch.  Tracks can be uploaded to the iPhone once you are back in range.  All tracks can be exported off the iPhone in GPX format for use in most major navigation software apps.Display Important TelemetryAll the information you expect from a handheld GPS is at your fingertips.  YoNav! can display 1 to 4 separate data fields.  Available data fields are speed, course, bearing to waypoint, velocity made good, distance off course, distance to waypoint, and many others.  All telemetry can be displayed in the unit system of your choice.Built in Sailing Countdown TimerAre you a sailor?  Do you want to nail the perfect start?  Use the built-in timer to countdown from the duration you choose.  Haptic (vibration and sound) feedback occurs at intervals during the countdown.  The tracking automatically begins as soon as the timer reaches zero.  You can ensure your sailboat is moving at full speed at every start. Leave all the complicated electronics at home next time you are on water, in the mountains, or just on the go.  YoNav! can replace hand held GPS units with a simple yet very effective app.While the paired iPhone is in range, the GPS of the iPhone is used for tracking.  When the paired iPhone is not in range the GPS of the Apple Watch Series 2 & 3 is used.  Please note that continued use of the GPS running in the background of either device can dramatically decrease battery life.Privacy Policy Summary: YoNav! collects calorie workout data while in operation on the Apple Watch and sends the workout data to Apple's Health app. It also collects and stores location information.

The use of these milestones was cross-referenced against a number of highly reputable sources.Milestones are divided into categories, with 93 in Movement, 100 in Cognitive, 80 in Social and Emotional, 76 in Language and 39 in Hearing and Vision. Milestones are provided at three month intervals up to the age of 2 and at 12 month intervals up to the age of 6.Recording the presence or absence of these milestones allows the software to calculate an overall development age for the child, and a development age in each of the above categories. This allows a more specific identification of strengths or weaknesses.Important milestones such as crawling, walking or talking are flagged if the child fails to acquire them at a specified age. These flags alert the parent or guardian to a potential problem and indicate a recommended course of action.Your Childs Development Milestones is an important parenting aid, especially for couples with their first child. It helps to reassure parents when their child is developing normally, alerts them to potential problems and identifies exceptional children at an early age.The early detection of development problems is very important as in many cases it can result in prompt remedial action which allows the child to develop normally. Failure to identify potential development problems early in life may hinder the childs acquisition of important skills and impair their ability to realise their full potentialThe inclusion of 388 development milestones covering five development categories and the recording of data at three month intervals for the first two years, makes this software the most detailed and comprehensive childhood development programme currently available.The inclusion of flagged alerts ensures that parents will not miss development delays in any important milestone.Provision for image and voice attachment enables parents to include an oral and visual record of their childs development.";"Your Childs Milestones, WWW Machealth Pty Ltd, Medical, Health & Fitness, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"3.0";4;"English";357431350;"WWW Machealth Pty Ltd";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/www-machealth-pty-ltd/id357431350?mt=8";0;NA;8,7;"2018-05-25";"2011-06-22";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;"2018-10-25";1;0;"Pediatrics";"EmergencyMedicine";"SensorySystemsHealthcare"

Assess your risk now and take preventive action if necessary.There are three major types of diabetes: type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, and gestational diabetes. All three types of diabetes share the same basic characteristic -- the body's inability either to make or to use insulin. Your body needs insulin, a hormone, to be able to use glucose, which comes from the food you eat, for energy. Without enough insulin, glucose stays in the blood, creating high levels of blood sugar. Over time, this build up causes damage to your kidneys, heart, nerves, eyes, and other organs.Diabetes has reached epidemic proportions and become a major health problem in many countries throughout the world.  The number of adults with diabetes worldwide has more than doubled since 1980 to 347 million.  It is estimated to be four times as common as all forms of cancer combined.In the US, 25.8 million people (8.3% of the population) have diabetes. Of these, 7.0 million have undiagnosed diabetes. In 2010, about 1.9 million new cases of diabetes were diagnosed in people aged 20 years or older.Some 2.8m people in the UK have been diagnosed with diabetes and an estimated 850,000 more probably have type 2 diabetes but don't yet know.

This app is the client app for iPad users.100% Web Server Based.  Because the ZipChart software is web based, if you are able to read this you already have everything you need to access all your patient's charts securely from anywhere in the world.  This web based technology also allows ZipChart to be deployed across multiple locations, without the need to implement expensive and complicated networking software.Optimized for iPadZipChart works on desktops and laptops, but it is optimized for mobility with the iPad. With this mobility design, there is no need to have work stations in every exam room. The vertically oriented screen is very much like a paper chart.  ZipChart doesn't require a great deal of typing skill, in fact most all functions are accomplished with the touch of a finger on an iPad.Faster Than a Paper ChartZipChart had to be faster than paper, or what was the point? Medical offices generate income by seeing patients, not from tracking down, retrieving, filing, and updating patient charts. With ZipChart, you can document a patient's encounter quickly and efficiently.Chart notes can be sent as fully encrypted email or faxed to a referring physician , nurse case manager, or insurance company with a simple touch of your finger. These documents can also be made available to your patient through the patient's secure portal.100% PaperlessIn a medical office there are always paper reports, referrals, transcriptions, and notes to add to the chart. That was true before ZipChart. Now all documents are either scanned into the chart via the included high speed document & card scanners, or captured automatically as they are faxed into your office. These documents are converted to PDFs and then easily attached to your patients' chart.Minimize Practice Impact As we have already stated, revenue is generated when physicians are seeing patients, so the goal was to keep the physician working with patients and not spending hours training on complicated software. ZipChart is simple to use, and most functions are completed with a click of the mouse or a swip of a finger on the iPad.For more information on how to sign up, visit our website at www.zipchart.com.";"ZipChart, ZipChart, Inc., Medical, Productivity, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"1.6.6";4;"English";320174991;"ZipChart, Inc.";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/zipchart-inc/id320174991?mt=8";0;NA;15,8;"2017-07-24";"2017-06-27";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;"2018-10-25";1;0;"Nutrition";NA;NA

For Zoe, who is crazy about crocs and barmy about bears this is a dream come true.  As the story unfolds, parents are guided through basic checks designed to help identify any problems with sharpness of vision, the ability to focus properly and to detect different colours.An estimated 1 million children in the UK have undiagnosed vision problems, and up to 80 percent of what a child learns is through their sight. So this innovative storybook, developed by Boots Opticians with the National Literacy Trust, contains a range of interactive eye check activities to help parents and carers understand if their child might need support with their vision, so nothing holds them back. The book is also designed to remind families that all children should have a regular eye health check.Its a great story and is fun to read but its also such a brilliant idea says celebrity dad Peter Andre, who introduces the story.  When I heard about it I was really keen to get involved. As a parent I know there are a million things to think about but making sure your children can see properly is incredibly important and they wont always tell you if they cant, because they dont realise.  I really hope this interactive storybook will get more parents to start thinking about their childrens eye health and about getting it properly checked out.Zookeeper Zoe is a first step in understanding your childs vision, and is not intended to replace a comprehensive eye check. It is recommended that children have their eyes checked at least every two years from the age of three. Eye health checks are provided free (courtesy of the NHS) in the UK up to 16 years old.  If your child needs glasses, you can also get an NHS voucher towards the cost, so often they are free of charge.To book an eye health check for a child or an adult, you can speak to your Boots Optician or make an appointment by calling 0345 125 3752 or click herewww.boots.com/en/Book-an-Eye-Test_1127693/Find your local Boots Opticians here - with 650 stores nationwide there will be one nearby - http://www.boots.com/en/Pharmacy-Health/Health-shop/Opticians/Opticians-Store-Locator/";"Zookeeper Zoe - Boots Opticians Eye Check, Rocktime Ltd, Health & Fitness, Books, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"1.0.6";4;"English";503202230;"Rocktime Ltd";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/rocktime-ltd/id503202230?mt=8";0;NA;41,6;"2016-10-19";"2016-08-02";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;"2018-10-25";1;0;"Pediatrics";"SensorySystemsHealthcare";"SleepAndRespiratoryCare"

The research linking too much sitting with increased risks of disease and premature death is quite eye-opening:A study of more than 17,000 Canadians found that the mortality risk from all causes was 1.54 times higher among people who spent most of their day sitting compared to those who sat infrequently.The risk of metabolic syndrome rises in a dose-dependent manner depending on your ""screen time"" (the amount of time you spend watching TV or using a computer). Physical activity had only a minimal impact on the relationship between screen time and metabolic syndrome.People who use a computer for 11 hours or more a week, or watch TV for 21 hours or more a week, are more likely to be obese than those who use a computer or watch TV for 5 hours a week or less.An editorial in the British Journal of Sports Medicine also highlighted much of the recent evidence linking too much sitting with biomarkers of metabolic health. They reported research showing sitting time correlates with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease and other prevalent chronic health problems.The application offers a unique approach to solve this problem.  The Application delivers exercise, nutrition, lifestyle videos on a regular basis that helps the end user with all the tools they need to achieve a healthy outcome.Included inside the App is a special chat feature that allows you to chat to help you with any unique issues you are having.Of course, the goal of the App is to bring an experience to the Zorad Chiropractic Wellness Assistant Community to help them achieve success.";"Zorad Chiropractic Wellness Assistant HD, Christine M.

The research linking too much sitting with increased risks of disease and premature death is quite eye-opening:A study of more than 17,000 Canadians found that the mortality risk from all causes was 1.54 times higher among people who spent most of their day sitting compared to those who sat infrequently.The risk of metabolic syndrome rises in a dose-dependent manner depending on your ""screen time"" (the amount of time you spend watching TV or using a computer). Physical activity had only a minimal impact on the relationship between screen time and metabolic syndrome.People who use a computer for 11 hours or more a week, or watch TV for 21 hours or more a week, are more likely to be obese than those who use a computer or watch TV for 5 hours a week or less.An editorial in the British Journal of Sports Medicine also highlighted much of the recent evidence linking too much sitting with biomarkers of metabolic health. They reported research showing sitting time correlates with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease and other prevalent chronic health problems.The application offers a unique approach to solve this problem.  The Application delivers exercise, nutrition, lifestyle videos on a regular basis that helps the end user with all the tools they need to achieve a healthy outcome.Included inside the App is a special chat feature that allows you to chat to help you with any unique issues you are having.Of course, the goal of the App is to bring an experience to the Zorad Chiropractic Wellness Assistant Community to help them achieve success.";"Zorad Chiropractic Wellness Assistant, Christine M.

The end result is the production of the ZS Score which is a numerical summation of the individual weights assigned to the different fracture patterns selected across the craniofacial skeleton. The final ZS Score can then be used as a means to rapidly calculate trauma severity, triage patients and plan for complex surgical cases.Within the app, users can also annotate their findings by adding a free text note detailing crucial information such as mechanism of trauma and GCS. This can then be published as a full PDF report through the app and emailed to other clinicians or printed using AirPrint technology.Features include:- A colour coded diagrammatic representation of the full facial skeleton where users can select any of the bones (including teeth) and fracture severity- Live updates on the most recent fracture selected- Pinch to Zoom functionality- Ability to add free text notes - Automated text summaries of all the fractures selected- Production of PDF summary reports displaying the ZS facial skeleton, numerical score values, automated text descriptions and free text.- Ability to email and print summary reports directly within appAbout Us:This app was based on the work of two authors, Simon Holmes (Consultant Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeon, Barts Health NHS Trust) and Zeeshan Ahmad (Junior Doctor, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde) who published their original paper in the British Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery in September 2012.Simon Holmes now sits as the national lead for the trauma special interest group within the British Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons in the United Kingdom and is also an editorial board member for our national journal. Both authors have worked closely together over the last three years in order to bring their vision to reality of creating a universally accepted maxillofacial injury scoring system accessible to all.We aim to roll out more apps over the coming year, and will be focussing on trauma associated with the base of the skull, post-operative patient outcomes and soft tissue injuries.
