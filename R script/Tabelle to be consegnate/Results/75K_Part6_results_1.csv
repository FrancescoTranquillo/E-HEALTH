In a natural disaster, disease outbreak, terrorist attack, or other major emergency, a network of local, regional, state and federal systems will initiate pre-planned and practiced responses. Above and beyond the actions you can expect from municipal and public health entities, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) recommend that you and your family prepare to take care of yourselves as much as possible in a disaster.For the most basic preparedness, this means:1. Having a basic Disaster Kit and supplies that will sustain you and your family at home, or a remote location for a minimum of three days.2. Collecting your Medical Information and Vital Information in one reliable and easily accessible location to quickly care for yourself in emergency triage scenario.

Its really enjoyable to feel every muscle of your body and feel that every part is charged with energy throughout the day after morning exercise. However, as time went by, I began to realize that keeping up with the load becomes more difficult  things that you could easily do while you were young became impossible. My limit was gradually going down until I heard about the Slow Burn methodology by Fred Hahn.The point is very simple: instead of tiring yourself with excessive loads on one muscle group performed within a short interval with breaks between sets, it's better to split the load on a series of sets with a small number of easily performed exercises each for different muscle groups. For example, instead of 5 sets of 30 pushups and 5 sets of 30 squats with breaks, it is better to do 30 approaches with 5 pushups and 5 squats in each set. There is no need to do the breaks between the sets then because sugar is not burned off immediately as at high loads. It leads to monotonic load that energizes your body for the whole day and brings much joy rather than stress. Then you simply increase the number of sets to reach your former limits in total. In general, its like cooking on a slow fire: you can either overroast your food immediately or gradually develop a perfect flavor.It is a wonderful method but there is one unobvious problem you face when you start using this method. It is a need to count your sets. If you have 10, 20, 30 or more sets its very easy to lose count because you tend to think of something else while doing your exercises. As a result you can either do more sets or less, which is even worse.Fortunately, I am not only a sport enthusiast, I also work as a programmer and I am a member of OkToGames team of like-minded developers. Our team has developed this simple app that utterly solved the above problem for me. Basically the app just counts the sets for you. There is no need to remember your current set because the set number is displayed with a large font. To move to the next set, you just need to tap the screen of your device. In addition, the app keeps track of statistics: time of set, average, minimum, maximum, total time, etc.Well, that's all. Enjoy the app and reach higher heights.

Created by SLPs and developed by Smarty Ears, LLC, the SLP Goal Bank serves as a starting point for busy SLPs creating goals for children and adults with speech-language issues. As such, it is designed for use by those individuals trained in selecting speech and language goals for special needs populations. The SLP Goal Bank contains 26 different treatment areas in which an SLP may need to write a goal. Each treatment area has a wide variety of goals ranging from preliminary to advanced levels. The SLP Goal Bank allows the SLP to select goals from multiple treatment areas. Recognizing that each SLP has specific criteria to meet for each client, the SLP Goal Bank also allows the goals to be edited prior to printing or sharing. In addition, the SLP Goal Bank also allows the SLP to create unique goals in a treatment area.PurposeThe SLP Goal Bank was designed specifically to help guide the busy SLP in planning and creating new and appropriate treatment goals for clients. The Goal Bank has goals for 26 different treatment areas from AAC to Writing. Each goal is customizable to allow the SLP to edit the ending level and criteria for mastery. Customization allows the SLP using SMART (specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and timely) goals to tailor each goal for the individual clients needs as required. How to UseThe SLP Goal Bank is designed for the SLPs use. From the home page the SLP has the choice of selecting Support, More Apps, and entering the goal bank.

It offers a quick but thorough understanding of the students' language and articulation skills. As some US states require SLP to cover students grammatical morphemes and syntax skills, these kind of questions has been added (as an option) to make it more comprehensive.The fresh interface will bring a new ease to screen the student, where some questions would need to be shown to the student. With a simple tap on a button, all distracting information is removed. We understand that clinicians are very busy, so we have included a time-limit and age group selection pages, so a quick screening can really be quick without missing too many of the categories that the clinician wants to cover.  In addition, TTS (Text-To-Speech) capability of the questions has been included.This Comprehensive Language, Articulation and Grammatical level Screening application for Speech and Language Pathologists was developed using a criterion-reference measure.Background:Since there are many apps on the market that thoroughly tests specific articulation / language skills, we intended to create an app that combines testing various essential skills based on student's age, is in-line with the common core standard, and is efficient in determining if the student needs further evaluation.In collaboration with experienced and certified Speech and Language Pathologists Bonnie Noehr from Los Gatos, CA and with major support from Lets Talk - Fenwick Speech Therapy Services in Los Altos, CA, USA, we combined language, articulation and grammar questions in an optimal blend based on student's age.";"SLP-Screener2: Comprehensive Language&Articulation, Neuro Leap Corporation, Education, Health & Fitness, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"2.1";4;"English";1037550798;"Neuro Leap Corporation";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/neuro-leap-corporation/id1037550798?mt=8";14,99;"$";120;"2017-02-21";"2016-11-01";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;"2018-10-25";1;0;NA;NA;NA

I was amazed at how ideal these apps are for students with autism. They are the perfect visual tool. Students with autism will imitate behaviors from a video more easily that from face to face instruction. Video modeling also gives the students the freedom to watch over and over again until the skill is mastered leading to the acquisition of complex verbal skills. I would recommend the SmallTalk apps to anyone working with students on the spectrum.

Dr. Shah is a pediatric and adult hematologist with a primary interest in helping his patients transition to adult care with confidence and competence. Dr. Shah's team of collaborators include IT personnel, nurses, MDs, psychologists, child life specialists, and volunteer patients.The first installments in the series of services are ITP (Intensive Training Program) and a symptom and interventions monitoring. ITP serves to promote medication adherence in children and adults. Patients receive three series of educational modules and quizzes over 3 months. During those months patients upload a 'selfie' depicting them taking their medication. Patients who complete those three months are asked to simply log that they take their medicine daily for three additional months. After those first six months patients may opt to record taking their medications or not but are continued to be followed until they will have completed one full year in the ITP. The other app is to help patients monitor symptoms and interventions. Patients are asked to make an entry in the morning and in the evening regarding their symptoms, including pain, and any interventions they may have used to maintain or restore health.

SmartStrips works like a sequential toolbox with:  a tool to recognise the test parameter via the QR code printed on the device;  a tool for reading the test (automatic visual capture); a tool for interpreting the readings, which may be of various types (positive/negative, positive/dubious/negative, semi-quantitative (value intervals), or quantitative, depending on the parameter);  a tool for creating files (per animal, batch of animals, farm, etc.); and a tool for exporting data (test results, date, geographical coordinates, comments, and attachments) to a remote computer or server.";"SmartStrips, DouWère, s.p.r.l., Medical, Utilities, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"1.0.30";4;"English, Dutch, French, German";430161388;"Frederic Blondiau";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/douw%C3%A8re-s-p-r-l/id430161388?mt=8";0;NA;44,2;"2018-03-06";"2017-10-17";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;"2018-10-25";1;0;"SensorySystemsHealthcare";NA;NA

SMIPS (Smart Medical Image Processing System) has been designed to facilitate the storage, communication and retrieval of images from a variety of often incompatible sources. The objective of the system is to provide a physician-focused interactive experience which is not commonly found in IT-centric medical records systems that are optimized to passively store images for archival or billing, almost as an afterthought.NOTE: Although a limited subset of its functionality may be used with images stored in the iPad photo library, the SMIPS Visualizer is NOT intended for purchase as a stand-alone product.BACKGROUNDIn addition to using medical images for the detection of obvious abnormalities, a physician should be able to manipulate them in order to observe changes, similarities and differences across multiple dimensions. These dimensions include not only space and time but also modality, including the type of equipment used for image acquisition, the techniques used to capture images, and the image type (for instance surface photography, x-ray photography or tomography). It is the observation of a set of differences and relationships - both natural and due to intervention - which provides a model to establish the appropriate course of treatment for each situation.Unfortunately, there are a number of virtual roadblocks that get in the way of realizing this process efficiently. These range from incompatibility between vendor devices to systems which, while allowing the retrieval of images from anywhere, provide no means to place them in context, to manipulate them cleanly, or to reorganize them according to significance or meaning.SMIPS is designed to overcome these obstacles using approaches derived from research in intelligent control, decision support, and self-learning systems. The core concept underlying these approaches is fairly simple: knowledge, and therefore intelligence, develops as a result of creating multiple, redundant, mutable connections between otherwise unremarkable - or possibly even conflicting - pieces of empirical evidence. Multiresolutional associations created between originally unrelated items of information allow us to ""see"" patterns and identify causalities which might otherwise be missed. The Visualizer, together with the overall system of which it is a part, constitutes a step toward the creation of an ever more intelligent knowledge base with broad medical applications.APPLICATIONS* Clinical Setting: One-stop real-time and historical review by physician and, optionally, patient * Telemedicine: Technicians with mobile equipment can work with physicians remotely* Screening Centers: Centralized bulk screening to identify patients in need of follow-up care * Collaboration: Real-time access by specialists for consultation or research* Academic Testing: Students can review cases and save their detailed assessments for evaluation";"SMIPS Visualizer, Zamania Consulting, Medical, Photo & Video, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"2.2";4;"English";668725759;"Zamania Consulting, LLC";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/zamania-consulting/id668725759?mt=8";19,99;"$";3,1;"2016-09-06";"2013-07-17";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;"2018-10-25";1;0;"Nutrition";"MentalHealth&Neurology";NA

I prefer the taste of frosty, milkshake-like smoothies.You can achieve a similar texture by simply adding ice to your smoothies, but I think it doesn't work as well, because the more ice you add, the more watery the smoothie will become, thus defeating the purpose of adding the ice in the first place!I believe homemade smoothies are healthier than the smoothies you buy at smoothie shops or the powdered smoothie mixes. That's because when you make a smoothie at home, you know exactly what goes in it - there's no hidden sugars or artificial ingredients, and the proportion of fruit to juice is often much higher than the smoothies you typically find in smoothie shops.-->Skin Clear and well nourished Smoothies -->Kidneys Cleans Smoothies -->Skin Glowing Smoothies -->Iron store Smoothies. -->Blood pressure Controller Smoothies -->App is optimised for iPhone4, iPhone5, iPhone5s, iPhone6, iPhone6+, IPad.+ Manage favorites for Smoothie Recipes + You can share the Smoothie Recipes via E-mail and Facebook.";"Smoothies Recipes Free - Healthy and Raw fit your body & life, Alpesh Prajapati, Food & Drink, Health & Fitness, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"1.3.1";4;"English";825407055;"Alpesh Prajapati";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/alpesh-prajapati/id825407055?mt=8";0;NA;10,3;"2016-07-13";"2014-09-17";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;"2018-10-25";1;0;"Nutrition";"Dermatology";"Cardiology"

A Snellen chart is an eye chart used by eye care professionals and others to measure visual acuity. Snellen charts are named after the Dutch ophthalmologist Hermann Snellen who developed the chart during 1862. The traditional Snellen chart is printed with eleven lines of block letters. The first line consists of one very large letter, which may be one of several letters, for example E, H, or N. Subsequent rows have increasing numbers of letters that decrease in size. A person taking the test covers one eye, and reads aloud the letters of each row, beginning at the top. The smallest row that can be read accurately indicates the visual acuity in that eye. <U+2605><U+2605><U+2605> Snellen chart HD FEATURES<U+2605><U+2605><U+2605> - Not entertainment app - professional medical tool! - HD iPad graphics - Correct distance instructions for test - Only useful professional tests - New FREE updates is upcoming! - Full iPad and iPad 2 support - Support for use with iPad VGA adapter with you monitor/TV/projector/etc. (c) Snellen chart HD - Care about your eyes!";"Snellen chart HD - Medical eye Diagnostic chart and test, KenigArt, Medical, Health & Fitness, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";NA;4;"English";428846514;"Dmitry Molokoedov";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/kenigart/id428846514?mt=8";1,99;"$";11;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;"2018-10-25";1;0;"SensorySystemsHealthcare";"EmergencyMedicine";"Cardiology"

Using SnoreBuster is simple. When you start snoring, the SnoreBuster app will pick up snoring sounds and make your band discreetly vibrate, replacing the poke your partner usually gives you so that you stop and readjust your position, before your partner wakes up. The science of it is simple; when you fall asleep your neck and throat muscles relax. This decreases the size of the airway and causes the vibrations.Readjusting your position opens your airways so you can breathe normally again. The result? Comfortable, and more restful sleep for you, and for your partner. The SnoreBuster App is an intelligently and elegantly designed app that can help you achieve the best sleep possible for better personal health, and theres nothing more valuable than that.This app is NOT a scientifically proven treatment option for patients whom suffer from Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) or Positional Obstructive Sleep Apnea (POSAS).This Application Connects to a the official Snorebuster bracelet ,you will need this device to use the app.";"SnoreBuster, Mark van der spuy, Health & Fitness, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"2.0.7";4;"English";694346117;"Mark van der spuy";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/mark-van-der-spuy/id694346117?mt=8";0;NA;33;"2017-10-30";"2016-12-13";2,6;5;20;20;0;20;40;"2018-10-25";1;0;"MentalHealth&Neurology";"SleepAndRespiratoryCare";NA

Youll hopefully never have to use it, but youll be happy to have it, when you do need it.If you have, or know someone who has been knocked unconscious, broken his or her back, fallen into a tree well or otherwise been immobilized while at a ski resort, youll see the potential value of Snow Rescue!Head injuries, tree wells and snow immersion suffocation (SIS) are very real dangers for skiers and other winter sports enthusiasts who enjoy deep powder. Every year casualties are claimed by these hazards, and it often happens when people are enjoying themselves outside the groomers. The goal of Snow Rescue is to reduce these casualties using the technology most of us carry around in our pockets.HOW IT WORKS:By tapping into existing functionalities in your phone, Snow Rescue can determine when a user has stopped moving for a duration of time, and then notify friends via SMS based on a Buddy List. Simply add friends and activate, and these friends are then notified if you for any reason stop moving for a given duration of time. The app depends on data to send a message to users on the Buddy List, so always check how good the cell service and data networks are at the resort where you ski.REAL LIFE SCENARIO:You and your two best friends, Mike and Sarah, are out skiing in deep fresh powder at your local hill. After an amazing run through the forest, Mike is no where to be seen where you usually meet up. Usually he would show up, covered in snow, and with a big smile on his face. Not today though. Mike fell into a tree well and is unable to rescue himself. The clock is ticking. You and Sarah need to go get help or go and rescue Mike yourselves.Under normal circumstances you wouldn't know that Mike needed help. He might just be taking a bit longer finding his skis or have taken a wrong turn. You and Sarah have waited for Mike and each other multiple times and everyone has always showed up with the big Deep Pow smile.But today is different. You all downloaded the Snow Rescue app earlier in the season and within a few seconds after stopping, you and Sarah receive a notification that Mike has stopped moving and where he is located. You and Sarah act fast and contact the ski patrol. The ski patrollers are able to rescue Mike within minutes of falling into the tree well, and he fortunately lives to ski another day.FEATURES:- Add friends to Buddy List via Bluetooth or Contacts- Automatically send message and location to buddies if you get trapped or immobilized- Set timer for when to notify your buddies- Warning sounds before alert is sent- Intuitive interface, requires minimal interaction- Runs in the background.

However, there is a significant hole in the AAC app landscape for individuals with significant intellectual disabilities.  We designed So Much 2 Say from the ground up with the intention to fill that hole.  There is no longer a need to spend hundreds of dollars on an app filled with features that are unsuitable to the individual.  So Much 2 Say was developed with two distinct classes of users in mind: the Learner and the Administrator.  The Administrator is one of several people that work with the Learner (parents, therapists, teachers, school & hospital staff, etc.) who make changes to the apps configuration as the Learner progresses.  We believe that both classes of users needs must be catered to in order to realize the full potential of the learning process.Weve simplified the interface to the bare necessities: the cards themselves.

The Medical Threat Assessment App from SOARescue is the essential tool for the mission preplan. This tool takes input for a wide variety of concerns for a callout and helps organize it in one simple, easy to read PDF. This can be a helpful checklist to make sure that common or even uncommon needs are considered.Our versatile app helps you create the framework for the mission preplanning. Do you have to be a Tactical Medical Practitioner to use the app? Heck no! Anyone in public safety that is conducting mission preplanning can find features of the app they can use. Don't need a section? Skip it and leave it blank. The PDF won't know... It'll still look filled out and professional.While our app is comprehensive for the Tactical Medical Practitioner, we understand it doesn't cover the Tactical Operator. Stay tuned for version 2.0 with the LEO preplan tool!Operationally sensitive information or concerned about OPSEC? As soon as the app is closed, the mission information is deleted. Nothing is saved in the app. What about non-opsec info? Create a profile to save the commonly used information like hospital destinations or flight services. This saves you that critical time of putting in the same thing each time. If it isn't in your profile, it isn't saved.As soon as the callout is over, click the ""resupply"" button to link to the SOARescue shop and reorder supplies used on the callout and get your kit ready for the next call.

This app helps children learn social rules and behaviors through stories. The Social Norms app is ideal for parents, educators, and speech language pathologists as it allows full customization. The users have the ability to add their own photos, text, and audio recordings to create individualized stories that teach specific skills that the child with autism spectrum disorder may have difficulty learning or understanding. The Social Norms app includes over 50 stories with clear graphics in the following categories:11 Manners Stories:  Saying Thank You, Excuse Me, I Am Sorry,  Saying Hi , Using the Inside Voice, Sharing with Friends, Asking for Help, Waiting for My Turn to Talk, Personal Space , Picking the Nose, Passing Gas15 Hygiene and Health Stories: Washing Hands, Brushing Teeth, Washing Hair, Brushing Hair, Taking a Bath, Showering,  Getting Dressed, Trimming the Nails,  Using Hand Lotion, Putting Sunscreen, Using the Toilet, Headache, Stomachache, Runny Nose, Eating HealthyThree Safety Stories: Crossing the Street, Bike Safety, Seat Belts Six Home Stories: Going to Bed, Cleaning Up Toys, Doing Homework, Helping Mom and Dad, Staying in the Chair During MealtimeEight School Stories: Asking Someone to Play with Me, Waiting in the Hall, Answering in the Classroom, Being Bullied, Being Teased, Recess, Fire Drill, Following Directions in the ClassroomFive Community Stories: Going to the Dentist, Going to the Doctor, Going to the Hairdresser, Going to the Restaurant, Going ShoppingFive Behavior Stories: Biting Others, Pushing Others, Pulling Others Hair, Hitting the Head on the Wall, Running AwayAlthough research is still needed in the area of teaching social skills to children with autism spectrum disorders through stories, a number of studies have concluded that using stories to teach particular social behaviors or skills are in fact successful and children may benefit from this type of intervention. Furthermore, evidence indicates that incorporating visual aids (e.g., visual activity schedules) has positive findings, suggesting that visual aids can be effective for teaching social skills and interactions (Reichow & Volkmar, 2010, p 161).The National Standards Project (National Autism Center, 2010) also supports teaching social skills through stories as an established treatment for children with autism spectrum disorder for children ages six to 14, with evidence-based findings.

Social Quest uses real life situations and contextual images to present the professional, parent and student with jumping off points for discussing the why and how of social language usage.  The app utilizes a problem-solving quest theme in which students navigate various locations and earn rewards linked to social competencies.Social Quest incorporates narratives about real-world situations in the home, school and community along with questions designed to increase positive social communication. The app is based on story-based intervention, a technique found to be effective for children with autism as documented in the National Autism Centers Evidence-Based Practice and Autism in the Schools (2011)*. Questions about what to say, do, and infer in a wide variety of situations will target skills such as perspective-taking, conversational maintenance and transitions, gauging other peoples reactions, taking turns, problem solving, understanding humor, greetings, and scripts for social contexts. Situations and questions also address development of self-talk for social situations, a strategy that can reduce anxiety and improve communication skills (Sze & Wood, 2007)Students earn visual rewards to reinforce their progress throughout the app, and these are based on key social competencies for upper elementary-high school students (Bedrosian, 1985, Larson & McKinley, 2003, Landa, 1992, Smith-Myles, 2004). For example, the Hall of Rewards will eventually be filled with virtual tokens such as a Steed, to help you be motivated and get going, and a Book of Spells, to help you make plans and complete tasks. Earned rewards can be reviewed at any time and can be used outside the context of the app to discuss and promote use of skills.Social Quest can be used to:-Help students identify a correct and incorrect response to a social situation.-Give students the opportunity to give more than one answer in a given social situation, reflecting the flexibility of social scripts.-Choose to respond to questions from differing locations: Home (kitchen, bedroom, living room, bathroom, garage/yard); School (classroom, auditorium/library, cafeteria, hallway/office, yard/gymnasium; Community (grocery store, mall, restaurant, neighborhood, movies, doctor/dentist office).-Stimulate individual or group discussion of occurrances and narratives related to students own life or similar contexts, which in turn allows them to practice social skills and language.Social Quest has the following Features:-Receptive Activity in which students identify correct answers to a social question (presented with text, audio, and accompanying image).-Ability to customize Receptive Activity to require student to provide one or two correct answers to modify level of difficulty.-Selection of specific locations and corresponding social contexts to work on.-Expressive Activity in which students respond to open-ended questions corresponding to those asked in Receptive Activity. Expressive questions are worded more broadly to promote generalization of skills.-More than 800 questions across Receptive and Expressive Activities.-Hall of Rewards provides virtual reinforcement of progress and context for further discussion of skills.-Data and report card kept on each student, report can be printed or emailed to parent or self for record-keeping.-Ability to add student photo or avatar to represent each player in the game.*See app description on www.smartyearsapps.com for full titles of references.";"Social Quest, Smarty Ears, Education, Medical, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"3.6";4;"English";348779167;"Smarty Ears, LLC";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/smarty-ears/id348779167?mt=8";24,99;"$";185;"2017-08-26";"2012-11-02";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;"2018-10-25";1;0;"MentalHealth&Neurology";"Pediatrics";"Dentistry"

It can help you to change the way in which you interact with the world so that you bring more harmony and balance in your life and can help with issues around self-love and acceptance, loneliness and emotional stability.When you are instructed to repeat affirmations, connect with positive feelings (e.g. happiness, joy, love), this will help you absorb the suggestions on a deeper level. You don't have to repeat the affirmations out loud but do make a strong connection with them.About the Ancient Solfeggio Scale and Healing Sounds:Modern science is now beginning to recognise what the ancient mystics throughout time have been saying; that everything is in a constant state of vibration, and therefore everything that is vibrating has a sound (even if its not audible). Everything also has its own optimum rate of vibration, and this is called resonance. When we are in resonance, we are in balance and harmony with creation.Emotions and mental states also have their own optimum resonance and with the recognition that every organ, and every cell, absorbs and emits sound, we can therefore understand how specific sounds and frequencies can be used as powerful healing tools. This is how the ancient Solfeggio frequencies work and is why the Gregorian monks used this specific scale for chanting and healing.These incredible tones each resonate to specific frequency that our original blueprint is composed from. Exposing ourselves to these frequencies helps to bring our bodies, cells and DNA back into balance. Different parts of our bodies and organs all have specific frequencies of optimum resonance (perfect state of health), and therefore listening to these tones allows the body to absorb and remember its original blueprint, moving it back towards its prefect state of alignment and resonance (health).Do NOT listen while driving or operating machinery.If you suffer with serious depression or epilepsy please consult your doctor before listening.Jason Stephenson acknowledge the pioneering work of Dr. Joseph Puleo and Dr. Leonard Horowitz in decrypting the ancient Solfeggio Tones and advancing Healing Codes for the Biological Apocalypse and 528records. Dr Horowitz contacted our office to say he had heard great things about our recordings and now sells them through his own website.c1e62136f0";"Solfeggio Relax & Sleep Meditation - Calming Music, Phil Burgess, Lifestyle, Health & Fitness, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";NA;12;"English";1279168111;"Phil Burgess";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/phil-burgess/id1279168111?mt=8";0;NA;148;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;"2018-10-25";1;0;"SensorySystemsHealthcare";"MentalHealth&Neurology";"SleepAndRespiratoryCare"

The same holds true for the human body, in that muscle tissue, knots and tension respond or resonate to specific frequencies when a range of sound waves are applied to the body.The SomaWave Therapy App for the iPad is designed to be used with the SomaWave Therapy Sound System or other comparable system. Transducers are specially designed speakers which emphasize the vibrational aspect of sound and are used to apply sound waves to the body. Two of these transducers installed in a massage table or relaxation chair are used for Stereo Mode. The ThermaWave Sound Tool or compatible transducer is needed for Mono Mode application.The SomaWave Therapy App generates a sinusoidal wave, the same tone produced by a tuning fork or a crystal bowl, and is often referred to as the perfect sound wave because of it's symmetrical and soothing nature.

The SomnoPose sleep position monitor can help you manage your sleep position.SomnoPose is designed to run all night, while you wear your iPhone or iPod touch. It continually monitors the device's orientation, and provides an all-night chart of sleep position, along with a summary that shows how much time you've spent in each general position. An optional alarm can be used to help avoid undesired positions.WHAT IT DOES:- Continually monitors accelerometer data to determine your body position.- Shows how much time you've spent facing left, right, up and down.- Provides charts showing position data for entire nights.- An alarm can alert you when you're in a position you've chosen to avoid.- Shows built-in help content.WHAT IT DOESN'T DO:- Does not transfer information from your device unless you explicitly export data. You control where your data goes.- Does not need a network connection (except if and when you export data)- Does not have in-app advertising, in-app purchases, or subscription fees.USER-EXPERIENCE FEATURES:- Scrolling chart on the main screen shows real-time position data.- Screens have dark backgrounds, suitable for use in low-light conditions.- Alarm volume can increase gradually to avoid jarring users (or partners).- Audio from another app can be played in the background.MORE FEATURES- Alarms and statistics are automatically paused while you sit up or stand up.- The angles for determining body positions are adjustable.- Chart images can be saved as photos, printed, sent to other apps, or exported.- Collected position data can be exported via email, messages, or other apps (as a CSV attachment).- Controls can be ""shielded"" to prevent accidental changes.- Uses the iPhone proximity sensor to shut off the screen during the night, saving battery power.NOTES* To use SomnoPose to monitor your sleep position, you will need to wear your iPhone or iPod touch in a stable, forward-facing position while you sleep. The internal help and the SomnoPose website help pages describe several ways of wearing your device.* SomnoPose is not intended to diagnose or treat any disease.

Eighteen stereophonic sounds derived from nature, random noise and minimalist music can provide something for everyone. Press a button to hear a sound. Press it again to stop the sound. Or press a different button. With each sound is a graphic for creating space within for your thoughts or letting go of your thoughts.Sonaura can help you create your own personal soundscape at times (intervals) when your ears are being assaulted by annoying environmental sounds (sonic clutter) that are beyond your control. It's also for times when you want to play Tai Chi or just feel like relaxing or enjoying some peaceful meditation and serenity. Sometimes the little ones are tired and fussy but just can't seem to fall asleep. Sonaura provides soothing, relaxing sounds such as heartbeat and lullabies to help them fall asleep fast and peacefully.Sounds include:Rain 1   Pouring summer rain.Rain 2  A gentle, light rain.Rain 3  Light rain with distant thunder.Ocean 1  Lying on the beach on a sunny day with breaking waves and distant gulls.Ocean 2  Ocean waves rolling in during the night.Stream  Gentle stream flowing across rocks.White  Random and equal frequencies within the audio spectrum.

In this App you will find 8 Guided Meditations between 20 and 30 minutes in duration. These meditations are designed to help you to create peace, calm and Spiritual connection. The purpose of this App is twofold. Firstly, I want to teach you that you CAN meditate using guided meditation as a technique. Secondly, I want you to have access to your own guidance system, be that through connecting to your Soul or Higher Self, or connecting to your Spirit Guides and other Spirit entities. These are the meditations used in my Spiritual Connection For Every Day Life Courses and are suitable for beginners through to advanced meditators. In order to connect to your Self, you need to disconnect from the world around you and meditation is the key to successful relaxation and Spiritual connection.Regular meditation is great for teaching your mind, body and emotions to relax. Life gets so busy and our downtime no longer seems to provide the relaxation we need to ensure we move through life gracefully. Meditation is great for depression, anxiety, stress reduction, sleep disorders, heart and lung problems, blood pressure, PMS, mental health issues, a range of emotional disorders, lack of motivation, loss of self, low self-esteem, addiction, feelings of Spiritual disconnection, creating a connection to Self and Spirit and Spiritual and Psychic Development.The Full Body Relaxation Meditation and Inner Sanctuary Meditation are designed to assist you to learn where you hold your stress and create relaxation. The aim is to teach you to calm your body, mind and emotions leading to greater wellness and also put you into a space where you can start to listen to your body and emotions and honour their needs.The Grounding Meditation and Chakra Meditation work with your energetic system to connect you to Universal energy for vitality and healing. These meditations are also beneficial for preparing you for connection to your Soul and Spirit.The Morning Meditation is great to start your day. Once you feel comfortable with your ability to relax into meditation, connect to the four elements of Fire, Air, Water and Earth for relaxation and healing. This meditation is ideal for setting your intentions for the day.Ready to connect to your Higher Self, or Soul? Soul Temple Meditation takes you on a journey to meet your Soul where you may connect to your own inner wisdom. You will be invited to ask questions of yourself and use your own inner guidance to construct a life you desire. We all have a Spirit Guide team and they are there waiting for you to invite them into your life. They are here to help you on your life journey, you need only ask for their assitance. Listen to Meet Your Guides Meditation, and invite their guidance into your life.Spiritual Development involves learning to create connections to Spirit, learning to trust these connections and understand that you are in control of your energetic space. The Channeling Meditation is designed to help you connect with Spirit entities. As you move through these meditations you may find your Psychic and Medium skills begin to open and strength. Meditation is the key to opening up as a channel for Spirit and as with all new learnings, practice makes perfect.The answers you seek to most of lifes questions reside within you. Spiritual connection is available to all so enjoy these meditations as often as you like. Go from chaos to calm, not just surviving but thriving. Meditation is the best medication you can use.

It is linked to all of the other seven chakras on a very profound level. The 8th Chakra, also known as Aura Chakra, the seat of the soul, is associated with enlightenment and ascension. It is located above our bodies, unlike all of the other primary chakras, which reside inside.To balance this very special chakra, we created Soul Star Cleansing, an App that will allow you to play a 423Hz tone that will help you clear this energy center while meditating on it. This binaural isochronic tone can be made even more pleasant thanks to the 8 relaxing songs you can play in the background. The first one is free, while the others can be downloaded in the premium version. The titles of the tracks in our playlist are as follows, and can be used to heal your soul:1. Muladhara (Root Chakra)2. Svadisthana (Sacral Chakra)3. Manipura (Solar Plexus Chakra)4. Anahata (Heart Chakra)5. Visuddha (Throat Chakra)6. Ajna (Third Eye Chakra)7. Sahasrara (Crown Chakra)8. Padaka (Soul Star Chakra)To improve your experience, we added a timer to control exactly how long you will meditate. You can unlock it in the premium version, and set precisely how long to listen to our music to relax. We highly recommend you to use headphones while doing so, as it will heighten your soothing music and binaural beat meditation effect.Once you have succeeded in aligning and healing all of your chakras, you will be able to heal your soul and your mind. Remember to use the correct mantra chanting when meditating on each energy center to make your meditation more powerful.We hope you can improve your moments of harmony and serenity through this app. May it help you find peace and wellbeing through your chakras.

The light-hearted animation is centred around Toby, a wise, older brother, explaining the process of having an anaesthetic to his younger sister, Lucy.  By telling her a reassuring story of his own experiences, he puts her at ease about the fact that she too needs to have an anaesthetic and by the end of his tale, she reveals that she is no longer nervous.The storyline has been painstakingly tailored to optimise accurate information delivery as per standards set out by relevant organisations.  This will be appropriate for children undergoing anaesthesia for any purpose  surgery, scans etc. The use of animation as a contemporary tool to teach about a process is a fun, non-threatening method of incorporating different active and passive learning modes in order to maximise understanding and memory.  The intention is that children and carers experience a greater element of control and preparation regarding their anaesthetic journey and will have been informed and reassured without even realising it.Volunteers and not-for-profit organisations have spent several years making this project possible by donating money, expertise, wisdom and endless hours.  It is entirely free to use.  What we do ask, however, is that if the animation is to be used by a non-NHS organisation, a donation is made to the Noahs Ark Childrens Hospital Charity so that we can make sure that our children continue to be so well cared for www.noahsarkcharity.org.We thank the following organisations and individuals for their support in the development of this animation:The Association of Paediatric Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland The Society of Anaesthetists of WalesPaediatric Anaesthetists Group of WalesGeldards Law Firm, CardiffSquare Root Design StudioMark Davies, Application design Laura McClelland 2015";"Sound Asleep., Laura McClelland, Medical, Education, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"1.0";4;"English";1052510744;"Laura McClelland";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/laura-mcclelland/id1052510744?mt=8";0;NA;283;"2015-11-12";"2015-11-12";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;"2018-10-25";1;0;"Pediatrics";"Cardiology";"MentalHealth&Neurology"

Do you have trouble understanding a conversation in noisy or crowded areas like a restaurant?

Some of the first clues that you may be experiencing a hearing loss are when you notice difficulty in noise, or it seems like people are mumbling when they talk.

You can think of Soundly as physical therapy for your upper airway. Snoring is caused by a weak and floppy airway that vibrates during inhalation. Soundly strengthens and tones your upper airway through a series of key vocalization exercises. Like other physical therapies, it can take several weeks to see the benefit. To make our therapy fun and engaging we have built it into a voice-controlled game. Simply play the game for 15 minutes a day to begin reducing your snoring.

This app makes that job easy and fun! The adorable mama bear is so inviting, that I often have kids drawn to this app before they even know what it is.(Simply Speech)********I really liked this app. It is cute, engaging, and offers prompts and targets for a tough area to work on with little ones. (The Speech Bubble)****Welcome to Mama Bears house! Here children aged between 2 and 6 years can practice a range of auditory skills. The Sounds at Home app was designed by a Speech and Language Pathologist to help young children be aware of sounds in their environments and sounds in words as well as following instructions which requires auditory memory.  All this learning occurs within the context of a house using familiar vocabulary. Research has shown that there is a strong correlation between phonological awareness and early reading skills (T. Hogan, H Catts & T Little. 2005; S. Rvachew. 2007).  Mama Bear welcomes the children to her home where they will experience 3 different rooms that target many different skills.1)Auditory Awareness - sounds in the living room  Children will listen to various sounds and identify the source of the sound that they hear.2)Phonemic Awareness  in the kitchenThere are 3 levels to the game with 20 directions each. The children find rhyming words and identify initial and final sounds in words.3)Following directions  in the playroomThere are 4 levels with 20 different directions each. The instructions become increasingly difficult ranging from identifying objects, following simple instructions, following 2 step and temporal instructions.Children are rewarded by building a puzzle when they accumulate enough points.The Sounds at Home app is easy to navigate and allows users to employ several tools to perform the following tasks: -Enter multiple students-Change settings and use randomization-Select auto-paging-Enable and disable score sound-Track correct and incorrect responses -E-mail results at the end of the session-Backup and restore dataReferences:T.

As a result they are often simple and repetitive. Lullabies can be found in every culture and since the ancient period.Typically a lullaby is in triple metre, or in a compound metre like 6/8. Tonally, most lullabies are simple, often merely alternating tonic and dominant harmonies: Because the intended effect is to put someone to sleep, wild chromaticism would be somewhat out of character.Many Christmas carols are designed as lullabies for the infant Jesus, the most famous of them being ""Silent Night"".With baby sounds you will:-sleep like child (soothing music)-go to bed happy (white nois)-rest all day (lullaby)-slumber quickly (bedtime songs for kids)-be asleep soundly (relax melody)-kip all night (sounds of nature)-doss (meditation sounds)-roger (sleep songs)As tiny beings, babies require quite a few things the average human would need, but in smaller portions or in different wavelengths. For instance, sunlightit's not that the sun will kill a baby, but if exposed to more than a certain amount, it could be harmful to the child. So also musicdepending on the genre and volume, what a regular person may consider soothing or relaxing may actually be more than a child can handle.Lullabies are often sung by parents in calming children, putting them to sleep, or simply spending time with them. The simple lyrics, nature, and storyline of lullabies are usually intended for children, and are therefore suitable for them. A parent can rock a child to sleep with a lull-a-bye, calm a discontented child, or singalong with a playing child.";"Sounds For Baby Sleep, Le Duy, Music, Health & Fitness, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";NA;4;"English";913720497;"Le Duy";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/le-duy/id913720497?mt=8";0;NA;25,8;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;"2018-10-25";1;0;"Pediatrics";"SleepAndRespiratoryCare";"Nutrition"

SA Heart and the Lipid and Atherosclerosis Society of Southern Africa officially adopt these guidelines. This statement adapts aspects of the guidelines to the South African situation. Using the updated Framingham risk charts, interventional strategies are based according to the cardiovascular risk score and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. The Framingham risk score refers to the 10-year risk of any cardiovascular event, and includes four categories of risk. Treatment targets are those of the European guidelines. The LDL-C goal is 1.8 mmol/l for the very high-risk group (>30%), 2.5 mmol/l for the high-risk group (15 - 30%), and 3 mmol/l for those below 15% risk.

It takes advantage of the physical properties of water such as pressure and temperature to stimulate blood circulation.Hot or cold water is used for the relief of pain, discomfort and treatment of some diseases. Hot water is used to soothe the body and relaxes muscles whereas cold water is used to invigorate and stimulate the body. Hydrotherapy has a massagelike feeling because the water gently kneads the body. Many seek hydrotherapy to revitalize, maintain and to restore health.";"Spa Werkz SG, Tan Hai tat, Health & Fitness, Business, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";NA;17;"English, Italian, Portuguese, Russian";947715692;"Tan Hai tat";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/tan-hai-tat/id947715692?mt=8";0;NA;22,5;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;"2018-10-25";1;0;"Cardiology";"MentalHealth&Neurology";NA

If we can cultivate more of a sense of space felt inside of ourselves and in our interactions, well be more calm, more balanced, more present.Mind-Body Therapist Marcel Allbritton guides you through steps involving breath and gentle motion while you sit comfortably with eyes closed. The meditation design is grounded in principles of mind-body therapy and delivered via the Mindtoon  framework.Aligning inhale and exhale with gentle movement relaxes the body and focuses the mind.  This Mindtoon helps you reach a relaxed and focused state, then guides you to feel the sense of space inside of you.One of the best metaphors to explain what happens when you do this daily practice is that it allows you to cultivate a sense of space.Space in your reaction to things as they happen. In other words, you respond more than react.  Space in your thinking. So its less cluttered. More spacious.  Space in your presence.And also a felt  sense of space just physically inside of yourself.  Less tightness.  The felt quality of space may deepen as you you repeat the meditation over several days or weeks.Mindtoon meditations are not medical interventions.

""Very Useful!"" ""Perfect!"" ""So Easy to Use!"" ""Great for my patients!""See why thousands of users around the world are raving about this app!People with memory impairments can become worried when they don't remember where they are or other important information. They may be unsafe when they forget to use a walker or apply the wheelchair breaks before standing. All of these facts and procedures can be engrained into memory using a repetitive and effective memory training procedure.This Spaced Retrieval Therapy app uses the scientifically-proven method of spaced retrieval training to help people with dementia or other memory impairments to recall important information. Recalling an answer over multiplying intervals of time, such as 1 minute, 2 minutes, 8 minutes, and so on, helps to cement the information in memory.Spaced Retrieval Therapy is an enhanced interval timer with independent data tracking and prompts. It automatically increases the time between prompts with correct responses and decreases it with incorrect ones. This app will help clinicians, family members, and students keep track of the intervals and performance as they practice up to 3 memory targets.*Put away your stopwatch and paper - this app is all you need!*Keeps track of expanding intervals and data so you don't have to*Works in the background while doing other therapy exercises or using other apps*Subtle sound and visual prompts let you know its time to ask again*Tracks accuracy and data automatically, & emails you the finished report""5 Stars - This app is a fantastic inclusion into my therapy toolbox.

AAC can range from using simple strategies such as gestures, through to voice output communication aids (VOCA) that generate synthetic speech from text or symbols inputted on a keyboard or via an eye-tracking system.However, many people complain that the synthetic voices pre-installed in these devices cant reflect their identity. People often have to choose from a limited selection of voices, of which only a couple might be from the same country as them, let alone representative of their own regional accent.It may have never previously occurred to you, but our voices are as unique as our walk, our eyes and even our fingerprints. A persons voice is an essential component of his or her identity.VoicebankingThe ultimate ambition of this research project is for people to be able to use communication aids that speak for them in their own voice.

Using small interactive games, Speakaboo helps therapists elicit target words which are automatically recorded. The therapist can access these recordings after the test to review them, score the results, and compare them to the pronunciation of a native speaker. In the face of a language barrier, showing the child's parents a comparison of the two recordings makes it easier to explain a diagnosis. The SLT can also use the app to play the recorded audio of their child back. This often results in a better understanding of the diagnosis by parents. The test takes only 10 minutes. The short duration makes Speakaboo ideal for working with young children who become restless during long evaluations. Speakaboo's entertaining pop-ups additionally help children open up.Children love to open the doors in Speakaboo.

Similarly if you are having anxiety about a particular object or situation and are not sure whether you need help with it or not the app can be a valuable guide. It also allows a user to see the graphical results of other anonymous users of the app who have the same concerns as themselves. This quickly demonstrates that the user is not alone in their concerns.Additionally, if you are worried about the anxious responses of a friend, child or associate the app can be helpful in giving a more objective understanding of the difficulties they are facing. Using the app with a friend in mind, may give some insight into their behavior and why it may occur. The app is simple and easy to use. It was written by a practicing psychologist and is based upon the latest diagnostic and statistical manuals (DSM V).";"Specific Phobia Test DSM, PocketShrink, Medical, Health & Fitness, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"2.4";4;"English";394742950;"Jason Gallate";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/pocketshrink/id394742950?mt=8";1,99;"$";5,2;"2017-11-08";"2013-12-16";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;"2018-10-25";1;0;"Pediatrics";"MentalHealth&Neurology";NA

You can generate word lists in seconds, focusing on specific initial or final sounds, clusters, or sound combinations. Pediatric therapists are seeing the positive results of children being in control of this app. The kids can hear and make each sound, then blend them together into well-articulated words. Theyll love recording themselves and flipping the pages  and youll love the progress theyre making. But there arent any pictures! Kids need pictures! Wrong! The child who sees a picture of a car will likely use their typical speech production and say cah. The same child who touches each sound individually, without necessarily knowing what the word will be, can copy and blend the sounds more accurately. Theyll surprise themselves with how well theyre speaking!Adults love Speech Flipbook too. Theres nothing childish about this app that can be useful for survivors of stroke, brain injury, and progressive diseases that impact communication. This app can be used in therapy to target:*Articulation *Apraxia*Learning to Read*Phonological Awareness & Disorders*Minimal Pairs*Dysarthria*Accent Reduction*Speech Perception for Deaf and Hard of HearingSAVE TIME with this talking flip book that is completely customizable to your needs.

Speech Rates allows for calculation of four articulatory tasks: /p<U+028C>/, /t<U+028C>/, /k<U+028C>/, and /p<U+028C>t<U+0259>k<U+0259>/. Syllable productions are individually counted by tapping on the task start button.Two calculation methods are provided. By selecting 'Seconds' as the task variable in the settings menu, therapists can calculate the number of seconds needed for clients to produce a predetermined number of syllable repetitions. Syllable repetitions are established at 20 for single syllable tasks and 10 for multi-syllable tasks.By selecting 'Repetitions' as the task variable in the settings menu, therapists can obtain the number of syllable repetitions a client is able to produce within a predetermined number of seconds. Number of seconds is established at 15 seconds for single syllable tasks and 10 seconds for multi-syllable tasks.Calculating diadochokinetic rates has never been easier or more accurate. Tasks can be selected by tapping a specific row within the summary table allowing therapists to evaluate tasks in any order.Each articulatory task can be individually reset to accommodate errors in client production.

For now, the functionality of the application is limited to speech data collection. We will disseminate this app to over 60 clinical sites to collect an initial set of data for analysis on the back-end. Eventually, the functionality of the app will be expanded to include outcome measures that track patient progress; however in order to do this, the app must be disseminated in its current form in order to collect data for algorithm calibration.Our participants' locations are nationwide (over 60 sites). We have developed the application specifically for the iPad and will purchase 60 iPads to distribute for this study alone. It is our hope to do additional studies in the future with this App.Distribution of the App, and future updates, becomes non-trivial if we are required to disseminate the app outside of the Apple App Store. Our intent is to make this research study as simple as possible for these participants with these diseases. The research study is partially funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and has the potential to transform the way that outcomes are measured in populations with neurodegenerative disorders.Initially this App will be used by specific clinics and research institutions to administer tests these tests to patients in a controlled environment.

With the goal of connecting swimmers of all ages and ability levels to the possibilities of splitting as smart as professional swimmers, Split Smart contains three main functions: Find splits using an inputted goal time Find goal time and appropriate splits using an inputted personal best time of another relevant race (ex. enter PB100 time to calculate final time and splits for a 200 race) Find how your favorite elite athlete would split an inputted final timeWhy is Split Smart exceptionally accurate?In the research phase, splits and final times of over 500 races were collected. In order to discover splitting patterns of the best swimmers in the world, we analyzed races from the following meets: 2008 Beijing Olympics, 2012 London Olympics, 2016 Rio Olympics, 2016 U.S. Olympic Trials, and the 2014-2017 NCAA Championships. Additionally, the top 24 times in Europe for both short course and long course meters were used. Using the collected data, mathematical equations were programed into Split Smart and are used in every result that Split Smart generates. ApplicabilityDiscovering how to split races correctly is a learning process that takes time and requires maturity in order to master. These difficulties lead to questions such as the following to frequently be asked on a pool deck:What should my splits be if I want to go X in a 200 Yard Freestyle?Did I split this race correctly?If my 100 is X what should I go on a 200 and how should I split that time?How would my favorite swimmer split my 200 time?Split Smart is a tool that gives swimmers a fast, exact answer to these questions and is a perfect app for anyone who has ever wanted to swim smarter.Continuously Evolving Split SmartOne of the best features of Split Smart is its flawless updating nature. After each major meet, the function for calculating splits will be revised in order to reflect the newest trends and best practices. In addition, Split Smart will follow the emergence of new champions, track their patterns, and allow for users comparison with the current best in the world. Notes:Patterns found in the research showed that there is a difference in splitting tendencies between genders and pool type. Please be aware that the gender you select in the My Profile page will impact the outputted splits throughout Split Smart.";"Split Smart, Marko Cancar, Sports, Health & Fitness, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"3.0";4;"English";1328525042;"Marko Cancar";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/marko-cancar/id1328525042?mt=8";0;NA;31,6;"2018-08-23";"2018-01-16";4,8;49;94;2;0;0;4;"2018-10-25";1;0;"Nutrition";NA;NA

The Spoonie Living App began as part of a student project, and gives you over 200 colourful and funky meme stickers to enable you to creatively express your health and illness which you can then share via your chats(!).Want to take part?  Heres more info:The Spoonie Living app was a small project put together by PhD student Sam Martin.  Sam has Celiac Disease, IBS and Arthritis, and she's in the process of writing up a thesis about how people with chronic illnesses such as Arthritis, IBS, ME, CFS and Coeliac Disease use social media to share experiences of their illness and find information.  The Spoonie Living app and Sticker pack was created to see if the use of illness and dietary related stickers would help individuals creatively express themselves in a slightly different way to general Meme images found on the internet.  It is hoped that using stickers will help towards people creatively managing their illnesses on a daily basis.But whats a Spoonie?The term Spoonie was invented by Christin Miserandino to describe what its like to have an invisible illness, like Asthma, IBS, Celiac Disease, Arthritis and more. 'Spoons' are used to measure and describe how someone would manage the amount of energy they feel they have left to complete daily tasks when not feeling 100%.  The hashtag #spoonie is really popular, and has been used just over 500,000 times on Instagram alone - it is mainly used by people with hidden illnesses to talk about their experiences daily. The aim of Spoonie Living app and stickers pack is to add to this experience with the use of creative stickers and see if this has a helpful/positive effect on peoples well-being. Stickers(!)Stickers have been designed to help you quickly express how you're feeling on a good or a bad day, and are illness (e.g. Spoonie) and diet specific (e.g. Gluten Free, Lactose Free, Vegetarian, Fructose Free).  Please feel free to DM me on Twitter (@SpoonieApp) or Instagram (@spoonielivingapp) with any suggestions for new stickers, & I'll be happy to add some new ones (and name them after you)! I can put all submissions on Instagram, and the most popular will feature in the next app update! There are 198 stickers free, unlock bonus SpooniEmoji images at end of the pack!Privacy This was a PhD project right? So what happens to your data?With the app, absolutely no data is collected.

There is no way to completely prevent these injuries, but there are tests that can identify risk factors associated with knee injuries. Some of these risk factors are associated with the athletes technique during jumping, landing, cutting and pivoting tasks. Other risk factors are commonly correlated with strength deficits, namely in the hips, hamstrings and quadriceps. If we can identify these risk factors in athletes, we can recommend certain areas to concentrate on during the athletes training regimen in order to decrease their risk of injury. The Sportsmetrics Sports Injury Test helps identify some of these risk factors associated with an athletes strength, coordination and body alignment. The Sports Injury Test allows you to take video of your athlete to assess lower body mechanics on a drop jump test, single leg squat and single leg triple hop. From the video, you will select specific frames to calculate knee separation distance during the drop jump test, knee and hip angles during a single leg squat and knee angles during a hop test. Within the app, you can add data for vertical jump, 1-minute sit up test, isokinetic tests, 20 yard dash, and VO2max. There are sections included for knee exam data, general notes and recommendations for clinicians. The app will compile a report to print out with side to side comparison of pre- and post-training tests. The Sportsmetrics Sports Injury Test was developed to work with the Sportsmetrics ACL injury prevention program. It is intended for use by physicians, physical therapists, athletic trainers and coaches. These tests are not meant to replace professional testing or advice from a healthcare specialist.";"Sports Injury Test, Noyes Knee Institute, Medical, Health & Fitness, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";NA;12;"English";1207001853;"CINCINNATI SPORTS MEDICINE RESEARCH & EDUCATIONAL FOUNDATION INC";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/noyes-knee-institute/id1207001853?mt=8";0;NA;6;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;"2018-10-25";1;0;NA;NA;NA

It complements the more formal assessment tools available to the speech-language therapist /pathologist or teacher. It was designed by speech and language therapist Judith Carey, in collaboration with Suze Leito, designer of Peter and the Cat Narrative Assessment. Although the tools primary use is with children who have language delay and disorders, the assessment can be used for children with a variety of language needs whether the primary deficit is due to disorder, delay or language deprivation. This established assessment is used by therapists, teachers and researchers across the world and is recommended in the recent influential publication, Developing language and literacy: effective intervention in the early years, Julia M. Carroll et al, 2011. Squirrel Story is a useful tool for determining therapy goals, curriculum planning and establishing pre- and post-intervention data. The Squirrel Story is not norm referenced, however guideline scores are presented from a sample of 100 children. The iPad version of the assessment uses the same profiling of language skills as our hard copy version but brings together an illustrated ebook with voice overs, audio recording, on screen profiling, dictation facility ( iPad 3 & 4 only), automatic report generation, distribute report by email.  This enables assessments to be made quickly and efficiently with less preparation time. The final report, together with the audio recording of the childs re-tell, can be transferred to a desktop computer via email. The report is in plain text so it can easily be incorporated into other reports or case files. The voice-overs for the story can be selected from UK, US and Australian speakers.

The educational content presented in this app is divided into three modules. Each module employs an illustrated book written at a grade 3-5 reading level, a quiz to test their knowledge, video clips of experts from St. Jude, and an interactive activity. These modules are designed to reach children with a variety of learning styles and backgrounds as well as to encourage children to think critically through problem solving and scientific inquiry.1. What are Cells? The Cells module allows children to explore concepts of cell biology by encouraging them to connect their knowledge of cells in the human body to their personal health. In this module, they read the ""What are Cells?"" book, which explains that cells, the basic units of life, grow and divide in a controlled way to replace old cells and help living things grow. They also watch a series of expert presentations that include an animation of cell division and compare healthy and diseased cells through an interactive microscope lab activity. 2. What is Cancer?The Cancer module allows children to explore the science of cancer formation by applying concepts of cell biology to diseased cells. In this module, they read the ""What is Cancer?"" book, which presents cancer as a disease of unhealthy cells that grow out of control, watch a series of videos which discuss cancers in children, and complete an empathy activity. In the empathy activity, they are introduced to a fictional child who is diagnosed with cancer and asked to draw how the child feels at various stages of treatment. 3. What is Healthy Living? The Healthy Living module allows children to explore their personal health by emphasizing their power of choice. In this module, they discover the impact of their daily lifestyle choices on their personal health by reading the ""What is Healthy Living?"" book. This book emphasizes the importance of making healthy food choices, staying physically active, avoiding tobacco use, and using sun protection as a means for reducing the risk of developing cancers in adulthood. They also listen to expert presentations about healthy living and explore interactive 3D models that demonstrate the damaging effects of tobacco use on the mouth and lungs.This app is an initiative of the St. Jude Cure4Kids for Kids educational program. The purpose of this program is to help children, their parents, and teachers understand the basic science and treatment of cancer. With culturally sensitive and age-appropriate content, the program is designed to dispel common misconceptions about childhood cancer, promote healthy habits in children that could prevent the development of adult cancer, and increase childrens overall interest in science and health careers.";"St. Jude Cure4Kids Jr. Health Explorer, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Education, Health & Fitness, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";NA;4;"English";858147605;"St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Inc.";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/st-jude-childrens-research-hospital/id858147605?mt=8";0;NA;590;NA;NA;4,9;8;88;0;0;13;0;"2018-10-25";1;0;"Pediatrics";"Oncology";"SensorySystemsHealthcare"

The scoring is automated, however qualitative information from each patient is determined based on time elapsed during timed subtests, pattern of responses and ability to process sub-test instructions. A full report is immediately accessible following the test administration, and can be emailed directly to the clinician.Ranked scores are provided in the report based on preliminary normative data collection.

Many hospitals are still using outdated paper systems with limited reporting capabilities, while others have adopted extremely costly software products that require large up-front investments.  Stafficiency is a fresh approach and offers:- Customized unit and shift time set-up per facility- Immediate and concurrent access to staffing data- Flexibility and portability (Stafficiency can be used from anywhere)- Ability to view and manage single or multiple departments- Notes section to help communicate specific staffing needs between hospital staff- Hourly rate tracking and reporting per role- Real-Time variance notifications via iPad or iPhoneHow It Works: Each facilitys individualized staffing guidelines are entered into the app upon initial setup, and staffing levels are recommended according to each departments current census, unique patient population, and established productivity goals. These hard-wired staffing guidelines serve as a metric for determining positive or negative variances, which are then sent as push notifications to decision makers. The app stores data and reports it in a dashboard format, which allows users to track variances and their reasons. This provides data-driven opportunities to improve processes that may be impeding hospital performance.  For a nominal set-up fee, reasonable monthly subscription, and the purchase of a few iPads and iPhones, a hospital can get set up and begin to improve and efficiently manage the staffing process.";"StafficiencyApp, Stafficiency Inc., Medical, Business, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"1.1.3";4;"English";1200660720;"Stafficiency, Inc.";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/stafficiency-inc/id1200660720?mt=8";0;NA;53,6;"2018-09-22";"2017-02-01";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;"2018-10-25";1;0;"Surgery";NA;NA

It is meant to be used primarily by patients, relatives, providers and pharmacists associated with Stanford Medical Hospital. Stanford Care Navigator addresses communication gaps by creating a secure communication group for all parties connected with a patient. Caregivers, relatives, patients and providers can communicate these things in a secure chat group:1. Patient's relatives can be updated of the patient's status (diagnosis, test results, surgery or chemotherapy schedules, next steps)2. Caregivers and immediate family members can ask ZingHealth's patient advocates, who are included in the secure chat group, questions concerning hospital logistics (where to show up, what to do, what to pay, when etc)3. Any medical questions that ZingHealth patient advocates cannot field will be answered by the patient's providers at the hospital or nursing facility.4. Pictures of relevant test results, oral  discharge summaries by nurses, oral consultations with nursing facility nurses etc can all be communicated via the care messenger.The CareBoard within the app summarizes medications, appointments and ToDo lists for the patient. Medication details like the dosage, frequency, copays (if any), pickup locations etc are visible. You can also chat with Zing Health patient advocates on scheduling medication delivery. All pending appointments, the addresses, time and duration, copays if any and other details also are displayed in the CareBoard. Finally, checklists act as remindes for patients which can mark them as completed. Providers can track adherence via checklists.We all hope this app makes lives better for you and your loved ones!

For this reason, the color scale will change between some factors. Otherwise you have a confusing situation where a large green area on one map is a problem area, where on another map, green would otherwise mean something more positive.The two color scale is used to provide greater contrast and make it easier to read: we want to be able to see how counties compare against one another, and also against the median. Because the numbers sometimes vary quite widely, we color the legend against the median value, instead of the mean (or average). Coloring above or below the median is in linear proportion away from median to the highest (or lowest) value. However, using the median doesn't fix all of the enormous ranges in the distributions. In the case of the population map, for instance, the upper half of the counties have values quite close to the median value, so they're colored much closer to black. On the other side, there are many counties that have sizes much closer together, which causes there to be a large number of counties that are brightly colored blue.";"Stats of the Union, Ben Fry LLC, Health & Fitness, Lifestyle, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"1.1";12;"English";432948016;"Ben Fry LLC";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/ben-fry-llc/id432948016?mt=8";0;NA;8,2;"2011-06-07";"2011-05-02";4,1;100;59;9;10;14;8;"2018-10-26";1;0;NA;NA;NA

There areat least two hundred distinct cell types, all with differentfeatures and functions, such as neurons (nerve cells), livercells, skin cells, and so on. These specialised cells arethe body's mature or fully differentiated, cells, all ofwhich are derived from their common ancestors, stem cells.Stem cells are a class of undifferentiated cells that areable to differentiate into specialized cell types. Commonly,stem cells come from two main sources:1. Embryos formed during the blastocyst phase ofembryological development (embryonic stem cells) and 2.Adult tissue (adult stem cells).Both types are generally characterized by their potency, orpotential to differentiate into different cell types (suchas skin, muscle, bone, etc.).Stem cells have the remarkable potential to develop intomany different cell types in the body during early life andgrowth. In addition, in many tissues they serve as a sort ofinternal repair system, dividing essentially without limitto replenish other cells as long as the person or animal isstill alive. When a stem cell divides, each new cell has thepotential either to remain a stem cell or become anothertype of cell with a more specialized function, such as amuscle cell, a red blood cell, or a brain cell.Stem cells are distinguished from other cell types by twoimportant characteristics. First, they are unspecializedcells capable of renewing themselves through cell division,sometimes after long periods of inactivity. Second, undercertain physiologic or experimental conditions, they can beinduced to become tissue- or organ-specific cells withspecial functions. In some organs, such as the gut and bonemarrow, stem cells regularly divide to repair and replaceworn out or damaged tissues. In other organs, however, suchas the pancreas and the heart, stem cells only divide underspecial conditions.";"Stem Cell, BIRANCHI N, Medical, Education, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";NA;9;"English";879967039;"BIRANCHI N";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/biranchi-n/id879967039?mt=8";0;NA;3;NA;NA;2,4;23;17;13;4;17;48;"2018-10-26";1;0;"Dermatology";"MentalHealth&Neurology";"Cardiology"

Risk assessment allows a clinician to choose less intensive, less invasive management of some young febrile infants depending on local standards, local resources, and particulars of the clinical case.  The app is adapted from the validation study by Gomez, Mintegi, and colleagues of July, 2016, with their kind permission.  The app is intended for use by health care professionals only, not by the lay public, not by parents.The app addresses such common questions as: what are the five steps in the Step-by-Step approach?what is the diagnostic accuracy of Step-by-Step?which special populations warrant additional attention?what are the cutoff levels for procalcitonin, absolute neutrophil count, c-reactive protein?how does Step-by-Step compare to Rochester criteria (older scheme which also tries to avoid LP)?aside from invasive bacterial infections, how does Step-by-Step do assessing for other serious bacterial infections? This app is written and intended for practicing clinicians like Peds ED physicians, pediatricians, and family physicians.

You can also draw and write, record audio, use the camera and insert your own images.FEATURESAll the features of the app have been developed in collaboration with children, parents and educators.<U+FF65> Share stories as PDFs or Stories to tell files (to be opened and edited on another iPad with Stories to tell)<U+FF65> Drawing by hand<U+FF65> Writing<U+FF65> Record audio<U+FF65> Insert figures and illustrations like emoticons, speech bubbles, characters, food, health, transport and communication etc.<U+FF65> Add photosABOUT SOCIAL STORIES AND COMIC CONVERSATIONSSocial stories is a way to visualize situations and focus on a conversation. What was it that happened? What could you do instead? How does it feel? Social stories can also show in a good way how other people perceive a situation and to understand other people's perspectives. The app can also be used to document your daily routines.Gunilla Gerland, author and lecturer with extensive experience of working with people with autism spectrum disorders:The advantages with the app are mainly that the result is beautiful, it's easy to save all social stories in the same place (and share them with others) and last but not least, that both for children and adults, it will be more fun if you can use a tablet. Here we have a tool that compensates for many of the core problems in autism: communication, social interaction, mentalizing (perspective-taking) and the ability to imagine things. Could we then, stop using the tool? The obvious answer is no. While everything does not fit everyone, people with autism are different and we do not force anything they absolutely do not want on anyone.

Also you can set practice timer for your practice session. 3)Use your finger to fully cover phones back camera lens. Make sure flash is lighting your finger from side as closer as possible.

Deep breathing bathes our cells with oxygen and fortifies our blood. Learn the 4-7-8 Breath: Breathe in for the count of 4, hold for the count of 7; blow out your mouth forcefully to the count of 8. Do this 4 times whenever you are feeling anxious, or when you want to fall asleep.  You wont believe how good it feels.Day 12: Your Posture! Did you know bad posture strains muscles, creates tension and increases stress?  If you stand all day, remember to slightly bend your knees. Locking them is a huge strain and drains energy sooner.  If at a desk, check your ergonomic design to reduce repetitive strain injuries. We all strain our necks forward too much.

Stress from work, stress from home, stress over finances, stress over relationships, and many others. All of this stress contributes to overeating, smoking, drug and alcohol abuse, road rage, physical disease, sexual dysfunction, and a myriad of other psychological ills. It is a sign of the times and a very unfortunate attribute of modern life.Dr. Frank G. Sommers has the solution, a powerful prescription that has been field-tested for over 35 years in his practice as a renowned psychiatrist and therapist. This stress relief protocol comprises 5 Easy Steps that can be performed within a few minutes several times a day.Our mobile app guides you through the 5 Easy Steps on a daily schedule (at least 3 times a day is recommended). The key to success is mindfully following the procedure so that it will effectively retrain your brain and nervous system. This is unlike any other stress management app in the App Store, most of which just play soothing music or sounds, display videos, or offer trite aphorisms.Special features include a reminders scheduler, which allows you to schedule up to 4 daily notifications. There is also an Image Manager that lets you add or delete photos which are used as soothing imagery to aid you in the relaxation protocol.An additional benefit of Dr. Frank Sommers Stress Relief in 5 Easy Steps is its application to weight management. There are many reasons for overeating, and daily stress is among the most prominent, though not always recognized.

It will help you to improve your health through respiratory training in biofeedback mode in which you control the depth of breathing.StressCam measures three aspects of your health:1. The level of stress. It is evaluated by the reaction of the heart rate to an increase in the activity of the sympathetic component of the autonomic nervous system. The algorithm is based on the analysis of heart rate variability (HRV). The level of stress is evaluated on a scale from 0 (excellent) to 10 (poor).2. Biological age. This is a virtual evaluation of your state of health, which is not linked to your real age. It is calculated by analyzing the respiratory component of heart rate variability.3. Heart rate (pulse rate).THE STRESS MEASUREMENT PRINCIPLEThe heart rate provides information about our body's response to various emotional and stressful events that constantly occur in your life. StressCam measures heart rate variability and calculates the stress level of the regulatory system on a stress scale from 0 (excellent) to 10 (very poor).THE BIOLOGICAL AGE MEASUREMENT PRINCIPLEStressCam contains a statistical model of the dependence of the depth of breathing on the person's age, which has a physiological basis.BIOFEEDBACK TECHNOLOGY Biofeedback is based on the ability of the body to consciously affect the heart rate by adjusting the depth and frequency of breathing. During biofeedback training StressCam continuously measures the heart rate and displays the inhalation and exhalation cycles with a predetermined breathing frequency. Depth of breathing measured by the pulse is used as feedback. During biofeedback training it is necessary to keep depth of breathing between ""good"" and ""excellent.""MOTIVATORSStressCam users receive virtual rewards as motivation. They are awarded for overcoming the various measurement and training stages, and the intensity of the measurement of their effectiveness.HEALTH TRENDSAn important feature of StressCam is the ability to view changes over time. For example, you can view to degree to which heart rate and stress levels have changed over a month in the tag Morning Measurement. Be sure to add a tag to the measurement results and a brief comment, as this will help you remember the context of the measurement.MEASUREMENT FREQUENCYWe recommend that you measure your stress level three times a day: in the morning when you wake up, in the afternoon before lunch, and in the evening. Daily measurements will allow you to observe the changes to your stress levels over the week and month. You can also measure stress levels during events of importance.IMPORTANTThis app is available free of charge with full functionality 7 days after the app is downloaded. After that number of measurements is limited by 2 per day. You can lift the restrictions by making a payment from your account in iTunes.To obtain reliable results when taking measurements try to limit your movements, and avoid any sudden changes in posture. To get the best signal gently press the finger pad on the camera lens. Do not push hard and do not take measurements in the cold because this pinches the capillaries and reduces blood flow.StressCam is for enjoyment purposes only and is not a medical application. We do not recommend that you use these results to take decisions on going to the doctor, diseases diagnoses, or treatment. Also, we do not recommend that you use StressCam for children or make any clinical conclusions from the results.REVEAL A NEW SIDE OF YOURSELFTake measurements, train, comment, share your results with friends and get rewards!Good luck and have a nice day! )";"StressCam - check your stress, pulse and bio age, DARTA SYSTEMS LLC, Medical, Health & Fitness, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"1.1";4;"English, Russian";1181118629;"DARTA SISTEMS, OOO";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/darta-systems-llc/id1181118629?mt=8";0;NA;58,6;"2017-02-26";"2017-01-05";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;"2018-10-26";1;0;"Cardiology";"Pediatrics";"MentalHealth&Neurology"

Also you can set practice timer for your practice session. 3)Use your finger to fully cover phones back camera lens. Make sure flash is lighting your finger from side as closer as possible. The detected heart rate should be pretty constant. If you see your heart rate changes too high or too low, you probably didnt fully cover lens with your finger.  If your finger feels too hot, you can use small plastic glass glue to back of your phone to cover your lens and flash.4)Remember the whole purpose of the practice of deep slow breathing is to achieve coherence with your nerve system through your smooth breath with concentration. Usually it takes a couple minutes to adjust your breath to get to the calm stage. 5)The suggested practice time is two, fifteen minutes session a day to achieve around 200 points.

Measure your stress to manage it!- What is the principle behind StressScan? - Many of the functions essential to maintaining human health are controlled by the autonomic nervous system. It is medically recognized that the balance of the autonomic nervous system can become disordered through fatigue and other stress, stemming from causes such as work and human relationships. By analyzing the waveform of your heartbeat as measured at the fingertip, StressScan can analyze the balance of your autonomic nervous system and measure your stress level on a stress index of 1 to 100.- You can trust StressScan! - The technology used by StressScan is based on heart rate variability analysis, which is widely recognized in the field of heart rate analysis and autonomic nervous system research. Although heart rate variability analysis technology is not yet generally well known, many medical institutions and companies have taken an interest and are beginning to put it to use. The technology is seeing use even at the cutting edge of stress care, including adoption by the US military to treat post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in soldiers returning from the battlefield, and by NASA for astronaut training and health management.- Usable in a range of scenarios! -  Periodic checking of daily stress level Checking the effects of favorite meals and drinks on stress Checking relaxation while traveling or at a favorite spot- Device compatibility -The app is intended for use with a camera- and flash-equipped smartphone.

App4web4k85 - April 15, 2016 (version 1.2.0 US store)Strobe Machine ***** The new upgrade is great or should I say superb. Anyway it is ....way to go ....way to go. Just keep doing what you are doing. GFB8 - April 14, 2016 (version 1.2.0 Canadian store)--=================================--To personalize the meditation experience, the user can select two colours from a palette of over 60 colours, glow effect (on or off), the strobe rate, sequence, continuity, and beat sounds. The size of the area of the screen used for the strobe can also be modified. The user can also select how fast or slow the change in colours occurs (sudden or blended changes.)In addition the regular strobe, spot strobes can now be used to create a collection of strobes in a variety of shapes, sizes and colours. The entire collection strobes as one set. When using one or more spot strobes, the regular strobe can be turned off (with a minimizing pinch.)When the app is removed from the foreground (for example during a phone call), any strobe effect is stopped and set to off. When the app is restarted, the strobe will not just pick up again where it left off. Screen data is easily hidden during strobing, by simply double tapping the screen to hide or show the screen data.The strobe effect can also be quickly cancelled (with the screen buttons hidden) by tapping the home button, or shaking the device.Upgrade the app to create a larger collection of spot strobes, to retain spot strobe data between app loads, to double the sounds and spot strobe shapes, to turn off ads, and to help support future development of the app (by paying the developer).The Strobe Machine is meant to allow the user to easily fall into a meditative trance. Do not use while operating heavy machinery, or while performing tasks which require undivided attention. Use the Strobe Machine prior to these activities to tap your inner resources which will allow you to excel.Use wisely and most of all, enjoy life.";"StrobeMachine, Antony Burt, Entertainment, Health & Fitness, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"1.2.0";4;"English";792212887;"Antony Burt";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/antony-burt/id792212887?mt=8";0;NA;2,1;"2016-04-11";"2014-01-27";4,6;23;78;0;9;9;4;"2018-10-26";1;0;"Nutrition";"MentalHealth&Neurology";"Surgery"

Each student's performance reflects their state of mind, in regard to issues relating to their studies and their wider social life. The SWSA, as it is commonly referred to, enables students to chart their own feelings of 'wellbeing' on a range of curriculum subjects, and also selected psychological factors.The SWSA enables students to score:A. Their confidence levels on the curriculum topics they study.B. Key issues in their life, such as the extent to which they feel they are 'Optimistic'and the extent to which they are 'Achieving'.When a student indicates their score out of a possible 10 marks on each item, they receive an indication of their moving average compared to their daily score. By pressing on those figures in the App, they can see the trend line. This indicates if their scores are going up, down, or remaining the same. They can also see which scores are at the high end, compared to those who score at the low end on the factors.The scores provide students with an indication of their self-assessed 'Wellbeing' over time on both academic and personal issues. First of all, the feedback provides a student with information for personal reflection and consideration. The feedback can provide the student with information to discuss ways to improve their scores with a teacher, and/or parent. Secondly, the data can be used by a student to share and compare their assessments with other students. This is valuable as a way of fostering mutual learning, help and support. Thirdly, students may wish to use the data to approach a counselor, if they have concerns about the trend of their scores.";"Student Self Assessment, ADVANCE PARTNERS, Y.K., Education, Health & Fitness, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"1.1";4;"English";601306459;"ADVANCE PARTNERS, Y.K.";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/advance-partners-y-k/id601306459?mt=8";0;NA;18,6;"2017-04-11";"2017-04-06";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;"2018-10-24";1;0;NA;NA;NA

Runners who perform intense and often insane workouts like - Intervals- Hills- Tempo Runs- Hard Runs- Speedwork- Cutdowns- Time Trials- Races (xc, track, road)HOW SUB4 WORKS(1) Sub4 for Apple Watch records your workouts.(2) Sub4 for iPhone reads, summarizes and displays workouts.The Sub4 system focuses on the quality portions of runs and workouts, gathering and storing metrics by the mile, kilometer, and workout split  tracking and reporting all progress in realtime  and then summarizing your workouts both on Apple Watch and Runners Log on iPhone.WHAT MAKES SUB4 DIFFERENTSub4 for Apple Watch is designed and dedicated to workout management for distance runners. In addition to time and pace reporting, Sub4 guides you step-by-step, reporting splits, keeping rests honest, and all the while recording all sorts of workout data metrics in granular detail. Sub4 for Apple Watch can not only handle pre-planned workout situations, Sub4 has built-in support for the unexpected ones, like the dreaded DNF. Life happens, Sub4 offers options. Perhaps you should skip the interval and catch your breath? Sub4 understands.On the iPhone, the Sub4 Runners Log readings, summarizes and reports your glorious running history in grand detail, with bright graphs and quality vs. quantity data breakdowns. Monthly, weekly and daily summaries are standard. Pace Zone and Heartrate Zone graphs too.WHERE IS MY WORKOUT DATAAll Sub4 workout data is safely and securely stored in your HealthKit database. This means its preserved even if Sub4 is deleted or you switch iPhones and re-install Sub4. All thanks to Apple. Too cool.WEATHERSub4 for Apple Watch lets you know when weather data is received. Pay attention. Launch Sub4 and tie your shoes. Stretch. When you raise wrist, look for a tiny weather icon on THE MENU. If necessary, repeat until it appears, but sure this icon is visible  before you setup any workout.TIPS FOR NEW USERSSub4 for Apple Watch was designed not just to understand workouts, but to be prepared for the expected -and- unexpected. Perhaps you twisted an ankle? Forgot to eat and feel sick? No problem. Force press. Sub4 allows you to skip the interval or end the workout entirely, or rest as long as needed, just hit skip again to begin next interval. Now thats cool. Sub4 is vocal. Sub4 guides runners through interval and rest periods with realtime visual, audio and haptic feedback. Make sure your audio is enabled and turned full blast. Same for haptics.One ding means go  Two dings means stop.Oh, and when setting goal paced workouts, pay attention to your active workout. Your screen will change colors to reflect whether youre on pace  or not. Its accurate to +/- 1 second.Red screen or split = fast Green screen or split = goodYellow screen or split = slowAS SEEN ON APP STOREWhile Sub4 does not yet offer its own watch face, our system does feature two cool complications for your Apple Watch. One is just a tiny corner icon shortcut, but the other - kicks ass. Its a modular utility watch-face complication that summaries your most recent workout.BACK TO THE FUTURERemember, this is just the beginning. Our goal is to move our sport forward by introducing more features, capabilities, and apps for distance runners, coaches and teams  but we cant change the world without your support.

We experience hypnosis when day-dreaming or when we have our attention intensely focused on something of interest. In this altered state of awareness, our unconscious mind is more open and receptive to ideas and suggestion.By using hypnosis, we can present information to our unconscious mind to bring about the changes we desire. It may be that the unconscious mind is viewing certain situations from a flawed perspective, which means that it is influencing our bodies' responses in a negative way, e.g. we feel anxious and afraid of something which is really not all that threatening (phobias and fears). In hypnosis, we can correct those flawed perceptions which, in turn, will result in the unconscious mind changing the way it influences our feelings and our physical responses. We can also present information to the unconscious mind about positive things we want to experience, e.g. feeling more confident in a certain situation and performing better. Our unconscious mind cannot distinguish between what is real and what is imaginary. When we use the power of hypnosis to present information to the unconscious mind in our imagination, our unconscious can accept that as real and will then go on to respond to that new information. It is important to know that the more you believe in the power of your mind to bring about what you want, and the more you commit to focusing your attention on what you want, the better the results will be. One session of hypnotic suggestions will not bring about much change at all. However, repeated suggestions in line with your goals and a strong focus on the outcomes you really want will help you to make these a reality.";"Success in Driving Test with Hypnotherapy, On Beat Limited, Lifestyle, Medical, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"2.1";4;"English";344500276;"On Beat Limited";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/on-beat-limited/id344500276?mt=8";0;NA;23;"2011-02-28";"2010-02-08";2,9;12;33;17;8;8;33;"2018-10-24";1;0;"SensorySystemsHealthcare";NA;NA

You can also use SuperVision in dark environments, by activating the flash of your smartphone.:-:-:-:-: INTERFACE :-:-:-:-:You can control SuperVision by touching directly on the screen, with an external bluetooth keyboard (cursors + enter) or with the volume controls. When an action is received (touch screen or key pressed) the control buttons will appear to setup the view. The application is fully compatible with the accessibility system of iOS (VoiceOver).:-:-:-:-: HOW TO USE :-:-:-:-:When you activate the control buttons you will see the following controls (from left to right):- Zoom - A pair of buttons for increase or decrease the zoom. - Contrast - A pair of buttons for increase or decrease the image contrast.- Cardboard Mode - Switch between cardboard mode or smartphone mode. - Reset - Configuration will back to predefined values except cardboard mode and bifocal mode.- Flash - Set flash on/off for dark environments.- Color Mode - Switch between color modes (3 natural colors and 6 synthetical colors for reading)- Pause - Freezes the image.- Bifocal Mode - In many situations, you probably need to alternate between far and near view. For example, watch tv while reading a book, or read the blackboard and take notes at the same time in the case of students. When bifocal mode it is activated, the application manages two setups: far view and near/reading view. The application detects both states using the orientation of the device. Simply look forward and adjust the controls for this view and then look down for setup the near view. The application will save both setups and will alternate between them automatically.SuperVision is developped by the Mobile Vision Research Lab and Neosistec. This work is partially funded by Generalitat Valenciana and MIMECO.

A laparoscopic appendectomy, usually performed as an emergency surgery, is the approach used to remove a patients appendix. If a blockage develops between a patients appendix and intestine, he or she will likely face severe pain as well as vomiting and possibly fever. When this is the case, it is necessary to act quickly because if the appendix ruptures, the patient could experience internal infections that can be fatal. During this interactive surgery you will learn about the advantages of doing the procedure laparoscopically and the instruments used to prevent the need for a large incision. You will also use specialized instruments used to cauterize the appendicular artery and cut off and remove the appendix.

Surgical technologists are members of the surgical team. The members of the surgical team are the surgeon, surgeon's assistant, circulator nurse and anesthesia provider. They possess knowledge and skills in sterile and aseptic techniques. There are few mandatory professional requirements for surgical technologists, and the scope of practice varies widely across countries and jurisdictions. Surgical technologists attend junior colleges and technical schools, and many are trained in military schools. In the military they perform the duties of both the circulator and the scrub. The goal is for surgical technologists to be able to anticipate the next move the surgeon is going to make in order to make the procedure as smooth and efficient as possible. They do this by having the knowledge of hundreds of surgical procedures and the steps the surgeon needs to take in order to complete the procedure including the very wide range of surgical instruments they may need. Specialties can include but are not limited to the following - GU / ObGyn, urology, ENT, plastics, general, orthopedics, neurology, and cardiovascular. They only work in surgery or peri-operative areas and are highly specialized.Disclaimer:The publisher of this app is not affiliated with or endorsed by any testing organization.

In her autism-focused speech pathology practice, she saw learners who experienced significant challenges in developing functional communication using traditional approaches. Often, learners would be unable to move beyond one-word expressions.As a multidisciplinary speech-language-pathologist Dr. Roberts brought together her knowledge of the syntax structures in American Sign Language, Skinners Analysis of Verbal Behavior (1957) from the science of Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) and created the SVO Power system and app. SVO Power can bridge the gap from little communication to more complex communication. It provides a mechanism for teaching the meanings of words and an understanding of how we use language to communicate. For many learners, especially those with autism spectrum disorders, we see that they are often very literal and successful with concrete concepts. SVO Power provides a very specific meaning attached to a word allowing the learner to know exactly what it means, leaving less room for confusion and more for meaningful use of language.The use of concrete words is encouraged, avoiding ambiguous words that could hold multiple meanings. This helps the learner avoid development of a rote repertoire of button pushing on a voice output device that often leaves one wondering whether the learner truly comprehends the message being created.  As a result of a language disorder, many individuals will not develop the full English language or need an intermediate step in building a complete language system. SVO Power supports helping the learner build a framework in his or her mind, but a less complicated one than that which is required by many other methods and AAC devices. Through practice, the learner will know they need to select a subject, verb and object to create a clear SVO expression; then, they will have the means necessary to convey a complete message. The components and syntax of a full language may be overwhelming and inefficient for some.  When working with learners who have difficulty acquiring a full language system including parts of speech such as articles, conjunctions, and prepositions, SVO Power may be the perfect alternative. SVO Power does use some prepositions, but only when the preposition is absolutely necessary for the meaning of a verb. The SVO Power app organizes the learners objectives by goal. Within a particular goal there can be a range of subjects, verbs and objects from which to choose.  In this Light Edition of the app, a number of goals are provided so the concept may be tried with your learner.  The app is offered in a Home Edition for a single learner, a Professional Edition for up to five learners, and an Institutional Edition for schools and other facilities.  In each of these, you can build your own goals with your own pictures and select from the provided picture library as needed.   For a complete learning experience, one of the other editions can be purchased through the in-app SVO Power store allowing you upgrade in seconds.";"SVOPower Light Edition, SVOPower Technology, Inc., Education, Medical, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";NA;4;"English";906513406;"SVOPOWER TECHNOLOGY INC";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/svopower-technology-inc/id906513406?mt=8";0;NA;115;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;"2018-10-24";1;0;"MentalHealth&Neurology";NA;NA

So does a hairdryer, which has an especially powerful impact on lulling newborns to sleep. As a happy father I can confirm the calming effect of these sounds. It is mentioned in many baby advice books and even midwives and pediatricians recommend using them.Especially in the first few weeks and months after birth, the sudden lack of the comforting and protective womb causes restlessness. The new feeling of having an endless unfamiliar space around them causes irritation and discomfort, hence leading to the search for the cuddliness of the womb. Colic is also often a reason for restlessness. Monotonous everyday sounds remind babies of their time in the womb. The time before birth is a worry-free, secure, and safe time in which babies feel the protection of their mothers. The sound of a hairdryer, vacuum cleaner, or even a washing machine is similar to the sounds they hear in the womb. These sounds take restless babies back to this time and help to calm them down.The sounds on this app are ideal for your iPhone and your iPod touch. This would also be the perfect gift for a baby shower. Energy efficient and always accessible, your sleepless nights will become a thing of the past.FEATURESHigh-quality stereo soundsEasy to use interfaceTimerPlaylistVolume controlIncludes 7 everyday sounds:- Vacuum cleaner- Hairdryer- Washing machine- Dishwasher- Fan- Breast pump- Running showerTip: It is highly recommended that the iPhone FLIGHT mode is switched on.

SweetBeat HRV integrates and correlates data from popular fitness platforms like MapMyFitness, Fitbit and Withings. By analyzing HRV and Stress along with additional data, SweetBeatHRV provides a deeper dive into health and provides insight into what activities you engage in that effect the health metrics you care about.IMPORTANT: SweetBeat requires external hardware:A tested Bluetooth Low Energy Heart Rate Monitors  OR a LifeTrak Zoom wrist worn device.  While other manufacturers wrist worn devices work well for heart rate, their wrist worn heart rate monitors are not accurate enough for HRV and so are not supported. They can be used for Food Sensitivity test.SweetBeat HRV can be used with iPhone 4S and newer, iPad 3 and newer, iPad Mini and newer, iPod touch 5.  Please visit www.BeatHealthy.com for a list of compatible Heart Rate Monitors and LifeTrak Zoom device, noting that the Wahoo and 60Beat dongles are not supportedSweetBeat has four main components:Monitor StressHRV for TrainingFood SensitivityData CorrelationMonitor Stress: With SweetBeatHRV, you can see your stress levels in real time, giving you the ability to take action to reduce stress. If your chosen stress threshold is reached, SweetBeats Relax screen prompts you with a deep breathing screen that includes calming images.NEW: Checkup mode is a 3 minute countdown ideally suited for use with the Zoom device. Checkup can be run with any compatible BTLE heart rate monitor chest strap too. The three minute session allows the Zoom user to accurately assess stress and power levels anytime during the day.Stats: The stats screen more widely referred to as the geek screen, shows all the metrics being measured. If using the HealthPatch, the user can view the additional provided metrics.Graph: The graph screen shows a real-time building graph of your heart rate from RR Intervals. Turning the phone 90 degrees counter-clockwise will bring up the graph in landscape. Export RR Intervals: SweetBeat provides RR interval export capability. HRV For Training: In competitive sports, improved performance is often affected by alternating periods of intensive training with periods of relative rest. SweetBeatHRV measures HRV, an objective measure of your bodys response to each workout and provides training recommendations based on the morning reading. Food Sensitivity Test: If you are sensitive to certain foods, you may not experience symptoms, though your body reacts by elevating your heart rate after eating an offending food. Low level food sensitivities may contribute to inflammation. This inflammation tells the body to hang onto stored fat to combat whatever stress caused the hormonal release. SweetBeatHRV measures your pulse three times after eating and assigns either a X (sensitive) or a green checkmark (not sensitive).  Correlation: The correlation screen uses a patent pending algorithm to correlate all of the data the user has shared with SweetBeat. This data will come from the app itself and any other apps or devices the user has authorized (Fitbit, Withings, and/or MapMyFitness). The correlation feature turns your data into useful information and provides insight into what combination of activities lead to desired HRV, stress or weight, giving you the knowledge you need to achieve your health and fitness goals.SweetBeat Features: Post your session summary on Twitter to share with friends.Customize your Relax screen images with your favorite pictures.

The initiative is materialized when Carola Castillo was doing a counseling session to a company, which business was the design and sell of beach sandals. Castillo observed on top of the desk a sort of a selection of samples with different sizes and color sandals. In 2006 in Argentina, Castillo presented her idea to Hellinger whom immediately tested its functionality on the stage. In an eloquent way, Hellinger used its own shoes to simulate a representative with them. When he saw the results in the movement of the patient, he was surprised.   Castillo begun to shape and experiment more until she was able to adapt this tool for individual consultations. The systemic footprints are able to recreate order and hierarchy while developing a diagnosis of the situation in order to seek resolution based on the systemic laws previously stablished. The result of the consultation made by Castillo was of such success that the owner of the company of sandals decided to create for her this product made from recycled materials. Carola Castillo has included the lessons and all possible usages of this tool, which she has learn from her experience over the years as a facilitator, in her book ""Ecos del Pasado"". In this new stage, Carola Castillo takes us to incorporate these footprints into a digital platform. Syfu (Systemic footprint for you) is an app that comes to fill the necessities in the new advances for therapists, consultants, coaches, teachers and masters.

By applying this process, you will be able to recognize specific diseases and prescribe the most effective therapy.Each chapter addresses one common complaint and begins with a case and guidance on how to organize the differential diagnosis. As the case progresses, clinical reasoning is explained in detail. The differential diagnosis for that particular case is summarized in tables that highlight the clinical clues and important testsfor the leading diagnostic hypothesis and alternative diagnostic hypotheses. As the chapter progresses, the pertinent diseases are reviewed. Just as in real life, the case unfolds in a stepwise fashion as tests are performed and diagnoses are confirmed or refuted.The third edition is enhanced by the addition of five new chapters--Bleeding Disorders, Dysuria, Hematuria, Hypotension, and Sore Throat--as well as a greater emphasis on how to master the process of working from patient level data (signs, symptoms, and laboratory tests). All chapters incorporate the latest research resulting in new and refined approaches to common symptoms encountered in clinical medicine.";"Symptom to Diagnosis-EB Guide, Skyscape Medpresso Inc, Medical, Education, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";NA;17;"English";818609416;"Skyscape Medpresso Inc";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/skyscape-medpresso-inc/id818609416?mt=8";0;NA;51,4;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;"2018-10-24";1;0;"Nutrition";"Surgery";"Cardiology"

"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/synchronaut/id657790975?mt=8";"Synchronaut";657790975;"Both";"Synchronaut is a brain wave entrainment program that can synthesize sounds. It creates both binaural beats and isochronic pulses.I wrote Synchronaut to be the entrainment program that I personally wanted to have. I believe it is the best on the store.Here's why:1. It's a real time synthesizer, not a glorified MP3 player. You can move sliders around and change the characteristic frequencies of the tones in real time, based on how you are specifically feeling in a given entrainment session. If your session is going well, you can lower the tones a bit. If you are having difficulty, you can raise them a bit.2. Binaural and isochronic in one app. Flip between binaural and isochronic tone at the press of a button, without stopping playback. No other app does both: isochronic works better for most people, but binaural is more effective down in the delta range, from .25-4hz.3. Presets. Bookmark your favorite frequencies and access them easily in the future.4. Programming. Even better than presets is programming. Synchronaut lets you connect lists of waypoints together to build your own custom entrainment programs. These programs allow you to vary the carrier frequency, the entrainment frequency, the type of sound, and the volume. You can chose the way that you transition from one waypoint to the next: either by stepping down in fixed time intervals, or by smoothly ramping down.For example, one of the built in presets, called ""Meditation"", starts with isochronic tones pulsing at 14.5hz. It steps down every five minutes until it reaches 6hz, and then it switches to binaural beats, which work better in that range. The binaural beats then keep stepping down to 2.5hz, and then hold steady there for 30 minutes. This kind of sophisticated programming is not available from any other iPhone app, and is hardly available anywhere, outside of specialized machines that cost $250-500.5. Low frequencies. Entrainment frequencies as low as .25hz can be useful for entrainment, particularly for helping you to sleep, but other apps inexplicably only go down to 4hz. The app can also emit very low carrier frequencies, which is also useful, but you'll need expensive headphones with good bass drivers in order to hear anything much in the lower regions.5. Oscilloscope. See the waveforms that are being generated in real time.6. Native iOS lockscreen controls. You can play, pause, and skip around from the lockscreen just like you would play a song in iTunes. This also means that it works with third party devices that you can plug an iPod into.Caveats:In the entrainment community, different groups of people use entrainment to accomplish different ends. I personally use brainwave entrainment as an aide to meditation: it helps me concentrate my mind and attain a state of focus called samadhi. Entrainment is also legitimately useful for falling asleep when played at delta frequencies less than about 4hz. Many people report benefits to their wellbeing just from listening to the tones without doing any active meditation. The U.S. government doesn't acknowledge any health benefits from entrainment; however, I suggest that you try it for yourself if you're curious.The free version is ad supported and does not allow modification of the built in presets. The premium version (purchased via iAP) allows you to save your own entrainment programs and supports further development. Even the free version is better than any competing product, so give it a try and let me know what you think.Binaural beats only work with headphones! If you listen to binaural beats over speakers, the sound waves combine in the air on the way to your ears, and become monaural beats, which are ineffective. Isochronic also works better with headphones, but is still effective over speakers.";"Synchronaut, Mason Kramer, Health & Fitness, Medical, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"1.1";4;"English";657790978;"Mason Kramer";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/mason-kramer/id657790978?mt=8";0;NA;3,9;"2016-11-05";"2013-07-02";4,1;8;63;0;13;13;13;"2018-10-24";1;0;"SensorySystemsHealthcare";"SleepAndRespiratoryCare";NA

In these laboratories, scientists are confronting the most challenging questions posed by living organisms using instruments and strategies provided by systems biology  an approach that, in Switzerland, has been fostered by SystemsX.ch. This national initiative was created and funded by the Swiss government to revolutionise biology research, and as a result to boost knowledge of the human body and the basic mechanisms of life.In systems biology, complex systems, such as those made up of different molecules, cells or organs interacting within a network, are studied as a whole by integrating competences and tools typical of different fields such as biology, mathematics, physics and informatics. This research strategy is producing remarkable results, since it allows an understanding of the complexity of living systems  something that is not possible when only taking each of the systems components into account separately. Indeed, the complexity of biological systems is so important, it cannot be overlooked, since it is the reason why different living organisms, and in our case different human beings, react differently to the same environmental factors, or the same medical treatments, or to illnesses such as cancer.For thousands of years, the human body has been an endless source of questions. Generations of scientists have devoted their lives to finding answers to these questions, leading to spectacular breakthroughs in our knowledge, and consequently in human health. Still, with each answer new questions arise, and the human body has now become the ultimate and most ambitious frontier for scientific exploration.Like in any other kind of exploration, revolutionary tools and innovative strategies are needed to reach new horizons.This is the story of a great intellectual adventure, an intrepid Swiss initiative, and a surprising journey through the human body.";"SystemsX.ch, GruppoCreativo, Medical, Education, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"1.1";4;"English";1246728505;"Andrea Mango S.r.l.s";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/gruppocreativo/id1246728505?mt=8";0;NA;959;"2017-12-07";"2017-08-31";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;"2018-10-24";1;0;"Oncology";"SensorySystemsHealthcare";NA

First you will learn the Eight Moving Patterns, or Postures, known as Peng, Lu, Ji, An, Cai, Lie, Zhou, and Kao.  Then, the Five Steps: forward, backward, left, right, and center.Tai Chi Chuan is a slow and relaxed moving meditation. Through practicing Tai Chi you are able to calm down the mind, locate your spiritual center, and consequently find your entire being. From the relaxed moving exercise, you can bring your physical body into an ultimate level of relaxation and natural ease, resulting in smooth Qi (inner energy) and blood circulation. This is a key to maintaining health and recovering from sickness.Today, most people practice Tai Chi slowly to develop their balance, strength, and vitality, and the martial applications of the art are often ignored. Originally, Tai Chi Chuan was an ancient internal Chinese martial art, 'Grand Ultimate Fist'; a highly effective form of combat specializing in short and middle-range fighting.  In China, t'ai chi ch'uan is categorized under the Wudang grouping of Chinese martial arts, which are applied with internal power (jing), using Qi (energy). The history of the basic postures in the Yang form can be traced back through Wudang mountain to Shaolin Temple, developed from a series of movements originating from ""Chang Quan"" (Long Fist, a reference to the winding Long River, another name for the Yangtze). Around 800 AD, a philosopher named Xu, Xuan-Ping is credited for developing a long Kung Fu of 37 forms, which included these common Tai Chi movements: Play the Guitar Single Whip Step Up to Seven Stars Jade Lady Works the Shuttles High Pat on Horse Phoenix Flaps Its Wings""Taiji Chang Quan"" existed in many variations, and eventually evolved into Taijiquan. Other forms of the same era such as ""Heavenly-Inborn Style"", ""Nine Small Heavens"", and ""Acquired Kung Fu"" also show similarities to what later became Taijiquan. The principles of softness, sticking, adhering, and using the opponent's own momentum against himself were established in these precursory martial styles. Bodhidharma's teaching at the Buddhist Shaolin Temple around 550AD, which detailed the theory of using the mind to lead the Qi to energize the physical body, is widely considered the origin of all Internal Martial Arts, including Tai Chi.Dr. Yang's tai chi can be traced back to the Yang family through Grandmaster Kao, Tao (<U+9AD8><U+6FE4>) and his teacher Yue, Huanzhi (<U+6A02><U+5950><U+4E4B>), an indoor disciple of Yang, Chengfu (<U+694A><U+6F84><U+752B>).Thank you for downloading our app!

Tai Chi is an internal-style Chinese martial art that can be traced back to the Chen family, the Daoists at Wudang mountain, and ultimately to Shaolin Temple. When practiced slowly for health purposes, Tai Chi is a type of Qigong.Qi-Gong means ""energy-work"". Qigong (chi kung) is the ancient art of building the body's Qi (energy) to a higher level and circulating it throughout the body for rejuvenation and health. Some Qigong is practiced sitting or standing still, while other Qigong can be a kind of moving meditation. This gentle Qigong exercise is a highly effective way to reduce stress, increase energy, enhance healing, and generally improve your quality of life.    Qigong increases the quantity of energy in the body, and improves the quality of your circulation through energy pathways, known as meridians. Qigong is sometimes called ""acupuncture without needles.""     Similar to yoga, Qigong can stimulate the entire body deeply with low-impact movement and develop a stronger mind/body connection. The slow, relaxed movements are widely recognized for their health benefits, such as boosting your immune response, strengthening the internal organs, muscles, joints, spine, and bones, and developing abundant energy.

Stream or download hours of lessons, like a private class.Taijiquan (Tai Chi Chuan) is an ancient internal Chinese martial art which has gained widespread popularity for its many health benefits. Today, most people practice taiji slowly to develop their balance, strength, and vitality, and the martial applications of the art are often ignored. Taijiquan, or 'Grand Ultimate Fist', is a highly effective form of combat specializing in short and middle-range fighting. These video lessons offer practical martial applications for each of the 37-postures of traditional Taiji, based on the forms passed down by Yang, Ban-Hou. Once the viewer has a basic understanding of these universal principles, you may use them to devise further applications for every movement no matter which style of Taiji you practice. In China, t'ai chi ch'uan is categorized under the Wudang grouping of Chinese martial arts, which are applied with internal power (jing), using Qi (energy). The history of the basic postures in the Yang form can be traced back through Wudang mountain to Shaolin Temple, developed from a series of movements originating from ""Chang Quan"" (Long Fist, a reference to the winding Long River, another name for the Yangtze). Around 800 AD, a philosopher named Xu, Xuan-Ping is credited for developing a long Kung Fu of 37 forms, which included these common Tai Chi movements: Play the Guitar Single Whip Step Up to Seven Stars Jade Lady Works the Shuttles High Pat on Horse Phoenix Flaps Its Wings""Taiji Chang Quan"" existed in many variations, and eventually evolved into Taijiquan. Other forms of the same era such as ""Heavenly-Inborn Style"", ""Nine Small Heavens"", and ""Acquired Kung Fu"" also show similarities to what later became Taijiquan. The principles of softness, sticking, adhering, and using the opponent's own momentum against himself were established in these precursory martial styles. Bodhidharma's teaching at the Buddhist Shaolin Temple, which detailed the theory of using the mind to lead the Qi to energize the physical body, is widely considered the origin of all Internal Martial Arts, including Tai Chi.Dr. Yang's tai chi can be traced back to the Yang family through Grandmaster Kao, Tao (<U+9AD8><U+6FE4>) and his teacher Yue, Huanzhi (<U+6A02><U+5950><U+4E4B>), an indoor disciple of Yang, Chengfu (<U+694A><U+6F84><U+752B>).

The Tailio device is placed under the litter box and tracks each cats weight, waste output, litter box visits, movements in the litter box and more  just as recommended by veterinarians. Tailio alerts you to signs of health or behavioral issues, so you can take action. Early intervention by a veterinarian leads to better outcomes, so your cats can live longer, healthier lives.In the Talio Mobile App:- Health alerts for each cat- Weight loss/gain- Increase/decrease in frequency of litter box visits- Increase/decrease in waste- Changes in litter box behavior- Missing - did not check-in- Charts and stats of weight, visits, waste for each cat- Vet report with each cats data history- Litter box activities for each cat- Litter box cleaning activities- Reminders to clean litter box- Reminders to recharge Tailio batteriesMore features to come in the future releases of the app:- Tailio community.  - Medical history. - Diet history.- Medicine reminders.Tailio works with multiple cats. Tailio learns about each cats individual physiology and behavior over time, to intelligently distinguish between cats. No need for cats to wear anything.Tailio works with most popular litter boxes of all sizes (S, M, L, XL, and Jumbo) and shapes including rectangular, oval, and round, with the exception of triangular/corner shaped boxes. Tailio works with open or enclosed litter boxes and any type of litter. Tailios non-skid top will hold the litter box firmly in place.Tailio works with all types of litter - heavy, light, clumping, non-clumping. So you do not need to change anything.You dont need to change anything about how you maintain the litter box- no need to reset, zero or tare when scooping or adding litter.Tailio will monitor all cats in the home that use a litter box with a Tailio device placed under it. If an indoor/outdoor cat uses the litter box while indoors, Tailio will monitor their weight and litter box activity.To provide the most complete coverage for monitoring the health and well-being of cats, we recommend using one Tailio device per litter box. Tailio will still provide valuable information when using a single Tailio device in multiple litter box homes, but will only collect data for the Tailio-monitored litter box. We offer savings on the purchase of 2 or more devices.The Tailio mobile app has a feature called Vet report. With one touch of a button, it generates a PDF file as an email attachment and emails it to as many email addresses as desired.

The Talk Genetics Oncology app helps healthcare providers quickly evaluate a patient's personal and family history to determine whether a genetics referral and/or testing is warranted. For quick reference, the app is organized by cancer type. For instance, if your patient has colon cancer (or a family history), the colorectal guidelines indicate the age cutoffs and significant family history features that warrant a genetics evaluation. The guidelines are based on national and professional society criteria that are often referenced by genetics professionals and the health insurance industry.Did you know there are dozens of genes and hereditary cancer conditions to consider when assessing your patient? A family can have many different types of cancers, all linked to a single inherited cancer gene. For example, your patient may have a personal history of prostate cancer, and a family history of breast or pancreatic cancer (as seen in Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer (HBOC) syndrome). The app is designed to guide your questions as you discuss your patients family history. You will be able to determine if your patient meets referral criteria for HBOC syndrome, or another cancer syndrome for which genetic testing is available.Referral guidelines by cancer site: breast, colorectal, prostate, pancreatic, blood (hematology), brain, endometrial, endocrine system, ovarian, skin, stomach, kidney (renal system), lung, and sarcomas. The Talk Genetics Oncology app also provides quick links to information about labs and genetic testing options, local genetic counseling services, and web-based telegenetic services.Our goal is to create tools that make it easier for you to help your patients take advantage of the latest advances in genetic testing.";"Talk Genetics - Oncology, Talk Genetics, Inc., Health & Fitness, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"1.0.10";17;"English, Dutch, French, German, Italian";1401611819;"Talk Genetics, Inc.";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/talk-genetics-inc/id1401611819?mt=8";0;NA;12,4;"2018-07-25";"2018-06-22";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;"2018-10-24";1;0;"Oncology";"Dermatology";"Endocrinology"

An interactive teaching device, Talk To Me 100 allows the child - by pressing buttons - to see words, hear words, understand their meaning and experience the joy of communication. Using the pinch and swipe gestures, the board can be expanded and moved on the ipad as needed.  This Free Version offers 9 of the most frequently used symbols and sounds.  The full version is priced at $5.99 and offers 100 symbols and corresponding sounds.The Talk To Me 100 iPad App was developed by a Speech and Language Pathologist as a way to facilitate errorless communication (in which the learner never fails, but is supported in all communication attempts) to teach beginning language skills. This new voice output app helps parents, teachers and therapists jumpstart verbal expression for children who are struggling to communicate. Talk To Me 100 allows the learner to control their environment, and to signal the point of readiness to communicate. Talk To Me 100 also provides immediate and consistent feedback, allows for practice and repetition of 100 frequently used words throughout daily activities, provides fun and enjoyment and lets the learner become accustomed to touch screen use. Talk To Me 100 is designed to provide communication partners with 100 words organized in a predictable format to use in an unlimited choice of daily activities. Sydspeak created this app for children with autism spectrum disorders, Down syndrome, intellectual disabilities, speech and language disorders and other special needs. Talk To Me 100 provides communication partners with a core vocabulary to begin verbal expression for all functions of language: imitate, comment, answer, question, describe, retell, accept, reject, repeat, command, request, explain, persuade, maintain social relationship and influence. The adult communication partner models one or more words by selecting the buttons and using their natural voice to speak the same words whether you are getting ready for school, eating dinner, reading or playing outside; opportunities for verbal interaction are unlimited. Talk To Me 100 provides a beginning augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) solution for people who have difficulty speaking. Once the learner begins to combine 2-3 words spontaneously to communicate a new or novel thought, they are well on their way to using more than 100 words, either using natural voice or using a more expanded and dynamic AAC device. This iPad app is a digital replica and companion to the original child friendly Talk To Me 100 available at www.sydspeak.com. Priced at $59, this tablet is similar in size and comes in a durable plastic case with 3AAA batteries. Research shows that when each communication partner uses their own personal voice output device, language acquisition is more efficient. For some children, a predictable pattern of images on a computer screen using the same childs voice has more impact than pictures on paper with changing adult verbal interactions. For the first time, we now have a powerful communication system where both partners can have their own affordable and effective language device with the same voice and symbols. The free version offers a sample of beginning language learning. I recently evaluated a 3 year old child who was nonverbal. His parents said he only spoke 2 words: mama and bye. When presented with the Talk To Me 100, he began exploring the board, pressing the symbols and listening to the words. I began using my version on the iPad, and he immediately began imitating my words by pressing the symbols on his device. What sometimes takes months of therapy to achieve, he was imitating words within a few minutes!!!";"Talk To Me 100 Lite, Sydspeak, Inc., Education, Health & Fitness, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"1.2.01";4;"English";457771911;"Sydspeak, Inc.";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/sydspeak-inc/id457771911?mt=8";0;NA;21,5;"2018-03-06";"2011-09-01";3,7;18;44;11;6;22;17;"2018-10-24";1;0;"Pediatrics";"MentalHealth&Neurology";"SensorySystemsHealthcare"

Dave has helped thousands of individuals and couples handle lifelong personal issues, as well as difficult marital problems.You can also book your paid session with Dave at a time and date of your choosing. The payment will be made at the time of session. The app just allows you to easily make an appointment. Many people each day are experiencing emotional issues they have had since their childhood. These personal issues affect their happiness. They affect their relationships or marriage. These issues can be anything from low self-confidence, shyness, low self-worth, tempers, communication problems, fears and anxieties, marital problems including sexual problems and infidelity, issues with intimacy, trust issues, problems with teenagers, control issues, money issues, and many other deep seated issues that are often not easy to discuss. Sometimes all that is needed is a trained counselor to talk to.But most people live busy lives and do not have the time or money to drive to an expensive counselor to get help. And many counselors never show their patients or clients how to handle the problem.<U+2028>This is where Dave Worthen is different. Dave is trained in getting a person to look at their problems by guiding them to look at them from a different perspective and by doing so, get clarity and a solution.Dave as a private practitioner, surveyed the community and found that people just wanted a way to access a counselor or coach via their smartphone and talk to someone when the problem was occurring. Not wait until the problem got worse.Now you can do this with this Talk With Dave application. You simply answer a few short questions and send your information off directly to Dave. Once Dave receives your information he sends you an in depth questionnaire you via email. You can fill out the questionnaire in the privacy of your own home.

They need not even have a smart phone to take an appointment. Patient would just need to send SMS and their appointment will be booked. The patient will get the token number and can get current status of token by sending the SMS.The app takes care to allow a mixed mode. That is if you have visitors coming through your existing system, be it directly or using phone whichever way it is. The app allows you to create blocks 1. For appointments User would need to SMS your number as  drap 2. For current status drcu.3. To know the commands if the forget sms HELP.4. The main screen will show the list of patients who have taken the appointment. 5. Next Button  Use this once you have attended the patient and you are ready to attend the next one. This refreshes the list.6. Previous Button  Use this only in case you want to move back the current token.7. Block Tokens  The intention is to accommodate people who come directly without SMS appointment.8. Auto Block  This will add selected number as block in the beginning of the session. It will also add a block in case you are done with last patient in the list and new appointment comes in. This is because the immediate slot cant be given to patient because of travel time required.9. Manual Block  In case you want to block few places manually you can add by typing the number and pressing block button.10. Percentage block  Auto blocks using percentage. So if the pattern is in every 10 patients 3 are co1ming directly without Sms appointment then set it to 30.11. SMS is chargeable as per your plan with Service provider. There are direct costs applicable on outgoing SMS. App has no relation with the costs in form of SMS.Settings1. Average time per person- Enter the average time required per patient. This is a important input for percentage block calculation. 2. Set Session timings  Select the session for which you need to set.3. Start Time - Set the time from which you want to allow users to book appointment for the session. It is not advisable to keep the time too different than actual time of the session as user might get Token number 3 but it will not move for an hour since you were not available. 4. End Time  Set the time after which SMS appointment for the session would not be taken. Day Session setting  Set the days in the week when you have the session. Like Session one is only on Mon, Wed, Fri then turn on for those days of the week.Vacation Setting- Allows users to notify that you are unavailable for certain period if the send SMS to book appointment. The app will send auto response. Please be aware that roaming charges might be applicable based on your plan.";"Talk2Doctor, Alagappan Karthikeyan, Medical, Health & Fitness, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"1.0";12;"English, German";1094155238;"Alagappan Karthikeyan";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/alagappan-karthikeyan/id1094155238?mt=8";0;NA;5;"2016-04-25";"2016-04-25";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;"2018-10-24";1;0;NA;NA;NA

Why use the GPS G-meter: no need to keep your iPhone in a fixed position or connect it to your vehicles computer system, which means speed readings can be taken discreetly, for example, during a test drive. Taking a number of readings compensates lesser accuracy. Acceleration is calculated only when the filter is off. Acceleration cannot be measured near tall buildings, in the mountains or woods.4.

The application asks patients to perform simple standardized tests of tapping fingers (index finger and middle finger) as singly or alternatively on a fixed spot on the screen for 20 seconds with each hand. The application records the characteristics of each tap including total number of taps in 20 seconds, contact time and interval for each tap and tap location. This detailed data will be used to look at patterns of tapping over 20 seconds for each patient. These characteristics will be compared for Patients with Parkinson Disease with normal healthy adults and also with their own motor state based on medication use and disease duration. The intent is to recognize digital signatures that can accurately and reliably assess and predict motor state of Patients with Parkinson Disease. This particular app is intended to be used by clinical researchers to gather research data and is not intended for any clinical use including diagnosis. This app was developed by faculty at Department of Neurological Sciences at University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) and is available to use for any clinical researcher with prior permission of UNMC. Please reach out to the author with any requests. Primary objective: Provide data on the following measures when screen of smartphone is tapped repetitively. a. Tap speed (taps per minute)b. Tap duration (each tap contact time with screen)c. Tap Rhythm (inter tap duration for each tap)e. Tap location (relative to the center of circle for each tap)e. Variability of the data over time when tapping is done repetitively (i.e. pattern of change of each of the above characteristics of the tap over a single effort. Scenario details:Finger tapping done over a circle with visual feedback for each tap (color change). Finger tapping done with each hand index finger one at a time. (Right finger tap, left finger tap)Finger tapping done with each hand alternating index and middle finger over two circles at comfortable distance. (Alternate tap)Finger tapping done over 20 second.

What if that is not the case? TeamSafe is designed for parents, coaches, and administrators who mostly volunteer and simply love to watch the kids play. The app provides a sports safety system of documentation, communication, education, and oversight that gives parents peace of mind, allows the coach to ""just coach,"" referees to just officiate, and provides risk mitigation for the sports organization. Our mission is to create a proactive culture and community of safety and preparedness in the world of youth sports.

Remember, we have set this app up as a game so have fun. If you don't succeed, learn the lessons, then try again. That's how games work. You only ever fail if you give up.The goal of TemptationTamer is simple:Accumulate successive victories over temptation to create runs of success. Every third unbroken victory you score, you receive a new trophy and unlock a new level with a matching coloured home screen. The coloured home screens work like the different belts in martial arts. Starting at white, work your way through yellow, orange, green, blue, red, purple and eventually black where you get the opportunity to win the game. Beware though, if you fail to beat temptation, you start back at the beginning. Think of it like a game of Snakes and Ladders. Achieve 21 successive victories and you will be crowned KING OF TEMPTATION.To help motivate you, when you feel that urge to snack taking over, simply press the Start button on the Home Screen and a 20 minute countdown will begin. Motivational images and quotes will inspire you to delay those impulsive urges. To help strengthen your resolve, you can either select images from one of our pre-installed categories that match your own goal, or create your very own playlist from images you have taken on your phone. The more personal your playlist, the better your chance of success.At the end of every successful countdown, you can enter either a financial or calorific saving. This will accumulate and show you your total savings as your efforts accumulate. Have no fear though, these do not reset if you don't beat delaying temptation. If you choose to save calories, you may need to estimate how many calories you just saved but it is worth making this approximation as TemptationTamer will then tell you how long it would have taken you to burn those calories off on a treadmill. That can be quite a revelation and really makes you think the next time you are tempted to impulsively snack!Now, we understand you are only human and you won't win every time. We are also aware that social science dictates that those working in groups or with some kind of support have a much higher chance of success. That is why we have installed a Buddy system in the Settings screen. This allows you to enter the number of a friend who will become your TemptationTamer Buddy. Every time you start a countdown, TemptationTamer will text them your result. They can then text you back with words of encouragement or support. Why not get a group of friends to start TemptationTamer together and use each other as Buddies? We can't emphasis enough how important this tool is in helping you achieve success!Texts will be charged at your standard network rate.";"TemptationTamer, Victoryvisions, Health & Fitness, Lifestyle, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";NA;4;"English";479482780;"VictoryVisions Software Development";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/victoryvisions/id479482780?mt=8";0;NA;8,3;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;"2018-10-25";1;0;"Nutrition";"MentalHealth&Neurology";NA

It cannot be corrected with eyeglasses or surgery, and may cause people difficulties with normal daily activities. It is much more frequent than blindness, although much more unknown.Many partially sighted people show no abnormality in the appearance of the eye itself. It is also frequent that a person in some situations may show no difficulty, and in others they require assistance or the use of a white cane.For many reasons, understanding how a person with low vision sees can be very difficult: due to a lack of awareness, because of the different visual defects, because its common to find several symptoms in one person, and because the percentage of vision loss may vary from one to the other. This application intends to help understand how people with low vision see, to help them understand their difficulties, and teach them to interact with them properly.It is a useful tool for different low vision specialists (ophthalmologists, optometrists, vision rehabilitation therapists, psychologists, educators), as well as for the affected people themselves and the organizations that represent them.In summary, the aim of the app is to bring awareness about low vision in order to facilitate understanding and improve social interaction for persons with low vision.";"Tengo Baja Visión, Retinosis Gipuzkoa, Education, Health & Fitness, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"1.2";4;"English, Spanish";1193554846;"ADAKI DISEINUA ETA PUBLIZITATEA SL";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/retinosis-gipuzkoa/id1193554846?mt=8";0;NA;9,5;"2018-05-10";"2017-11-07";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;"2018-10-25";1;0;"SensorySystemsHealthcare";"MentalHealth&Neurology";"Cardiology"

Therapy For Verbs is a professional speech therapy app designed for children and adults who need to improve their spoken and written verb comprehension, verb retrieval and naming as well as verb production in sentences. Verbs describe what is happening rather than a person, place or thing. We use verbs all the time when we talk yet they are often overlooked in therapy and assessment.Therapy For Verbs has 6 activities:ComprehensionListen: In the activity, the person is required to understand the spoken verb and match it to the corresponding picture. There is a choice of 2, 3, 4 or 6 pictures. Read: In this activity, the person is required to read and understand the written verb and match it to the corresponding picture. There is a choice of 2, 3, 4 or 6 pictures. Naming & Sentence Production Repeat: This activity uses an evidence-based treatment approach called Errorless Learning. The app repeats the name of the verb 3 times and asks the user to repeat 3 times. Describe: This activity uses an evidence-based treatment approach called Semantic Feature Analysis. There are 6 questions designed to prompt the user to describe each feature of the action/verb and ultimately improve their naming/verb retrieval.Elaborate: This activity is based on a treatment approach called Response Elaboration Therapy. It uses 'Wh' questions (Who, What, Where, Why) to help the user to expand their answers when describing the picture. Assessment Verb Test:  A fully customizable test which allows you to choose the verbs you wish to include. Keep track of client progress over time by emailing result summaries or by checking the in-built record of scores.The app includes:- Over 100 clear, large, high-quality color pictures of people doing a range of activities such as eating a hamburger, driving a car, bowling, sight-seeing etc. - Adjustable difficulty levels in comprehension tasks- The option to add multiple users - Results summary that can be emailed- Results tracking and inbuilt storage- No subscriptions, no monthly bills, no Wi-fi needed All Aptus Speech & Language Therapy apps participate in the 50% off Volume Purchase Program, so talk to your school about buying in bulk!";"Therapy for Verbs, APTUS SPEECH & LANGUAGE THERAPY LTD, Education, Medical, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"2.0";4;"English";590816229;"APTUS SPEECH & LANGUAGE THERAPY LTD";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/aptus-speech-language-therapy-ltd/id590816229?mt=8";14,99;"$";93,6;"2017-11-05";"2015-06-24";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;"2018-10-25";1;0;"Nutrition";"Pediatrics";NA

This health education App from the 'Consider Your Health' series contains a 10 minute video with captivating 3D animations, voiceover & graphics. It takes you on a guided tour of the anatomical structures of the brain, to demonstrate the structures affected when alcohol is consumed. These include the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, medulla, frontal lobes, hypothalamus, & nerve cells. We also take a look at BAC, or blood alcohol concentration, which is important to understand why a person is affected by alcohol. The BAC and the effects of alcohol go up when the body is taking in alcohol faster than it can metabolise it. Once in the brain alcohol acts primarily on the nerve cells, interfering with the communication between nerve cells in the brain and other cells, slowing everything down. Adventist Health believe in abstinence from alcohol. After viewing the video, to assist your understanding of this topic, you can complete a Quiz consisting of 20 multiple choice questions. The Quiz includes an optional ""Hint"" button which enables you to review the portion of the video related to the question. However if a ""Hint"" is used to answer the question, the maximum score out of 1 for a correct answer will be 0.5.  You also have the option to Tweet your results to others.About Adventist Health:Adventist Health (South Pacific)This resource has been prepared by the team at Adventist Health (South Pacific).

Users can incorporate these insights into their daily rituals through setting up scheduled reminders and location based reminders, so insights are received at the most opportune time.They can also use the Audio Insights as part of their mediation practice.  Our assumptions about the world and everyone in it have a profound impact on how we experience life. Believing something is safe or wrong or worthwhile or impossible determines whether we engage freely or stand on the sidelines, whether we enjoy being in our skin or shake in our boots. However, many of these beliefs exist in our subconscious mind where we are not aware of either their influence or even their existence.The human brain can only consciously process so much data at a time so its number one life-hack is to learn something as fast as it can and then wire it up as a program that it can run subconsciously on autopilot. The brain has a program for everything: from how to interpret other peoples facial expressions, to how we respond to disappointment, to what body language to use in the presence of perceived authority.Each of these programs includes a set of associated beliefs. The problem is that many of these beliefs were wired into our brains during childhood or in a heightened emotional state, without any form of evaluation or before wed even developed our own value system. This means that we can end up running all day long on autopilot, fuelled by beliefs we may not even agree with.The good news is wrapped up in the word neuroplasticity.In our developmental years our brains were supercharged to absorb information, constantly growing, wiring and pruning neural connections. Neuroplasticity refers to the brains ability to continually change and adapt its physical structure in response to what we focus on and how we think, feel and behave.Although this ability becomes less efficient with age, neuroscientists describe how in adulthood we can intentionally create the conditions the brain needs to harness this self directed plasticity. These conditions are focused concentration, repetition and perseverance and this is where the Thinkladder app comes into play.Thinkladder's four unique tools are designed to help you rewrite the script in your subconscious mind. When we replace our outdated beliefs it disrupts the smooth running of our old automated programmes and allows us to experiment with a new set of actions. As we rehearse these new beliefs and actions with focused concentration and perseverance, they become our new normal.The Insight Finder helps you grow in self-awareness and identify the subconscious beliefs that are  fuelling your unwanted habits, and automatic thoughts and moods. It also allows you to select empowering alternative insights that align with your goals and values.Insight Reminders bring your selected insights to your attention at regular intervals, providing the repetition your brain needs to assimilate these empowering ideas. Insight Alerts allow you to identify specific contexts and places that often trigger programmed responses that you would like to change. For example, you may recognise that shopping malls trigger self-loathing, or visiting your in-laws triggers defensiveness, or your workplace triggers perfectionism.

Its activation site, in fact, is right between the eyebrows in a position known as the third eye. Even if you do not have a lot of familiarity with chakras, you may have heard of this term already. The ones who meditate on the indigo chakra are said to be granted occult powers; they will be able to enter another body at will and to become omniscient.To balance this chakra, we created Third Eye Cleansing, an App that will allow you to play a 144Hz tone that will help you clear this energy center while meditating on it. This binaural isochronic tone can be made even more pleasant thanks to the 7 relaxing songs you can play in the background. The first one is free, while the others can be downloaded in the premium version. The titles of the tracks in our playlist are as follows, and can be used to heal your soul:1. Visualization 2. Perception 3. Eye of the Soul 4. Heaven and Earth 5. Healing Balancing 6. Divine Bliss 7. Lucid Dreams To improve your experience, we added a timer to control exactly how long you will meditate. You can unlock it in the premium version, and set precisely how long to listen to our music to relax.Why is it important to meditate on Ajna while using music to relax? The third chakra's name can be translated as command; it can be considered the center of intellect and intuition. When something is seen in a dream, it is seen by Ajna. When you understand something or you have an epiphany, it is thanks to Anja. The sixth chakra is a bridge that connects minds, allowing communication to take place between us not only on a physical level but on a transcendental one as well.We hope you can improve your moments of harmony and serenity through this app. May it help you find peace and wellbeing through your seven chakras.

It was a school project of a few art students, and to a surprise for the creators it attracted lots of visitors for years to come. In 2012 Thisissand was developed into an app and is still run by an original founder.Thisissand offers different kinds of tools for choosing the sand color. Originally and still at the moment on Thisissand website, only the essential Color Palette tool is available. For the app, we have developed a few special kinds of tools which we offer in the Toolkit in-app purchase. Just like on the website, the special tools are not at all necessary to enjoy the app, but they're pretty cool and we're happy and thankful for your support if you're willing to try them out!COLOR PALETTE: Use Color Palette to choose specific colors from a vast swatch of colors. You may choose a solid color, or multiple colors to variate between. Use the intensity slider to adjust how fast the colors change. You may also use the randomize button to get surprising color combos.COLOR SHIFTER: Color Shifter continuously changes the sand color subtly or dramatically depending on the intensity slider adjustment. Color Shifter often produces rainbow like hues. To set the initial Color Shifter color, choose a color with Color Palette and then select the Color Shifter tool.COLOR PICKER: With Color Picker, you may pick the sand color from around you using your device camera. It takes a little practice to point your camera and draw at the same time, but in return you get truly unique colors. Try adjusting the color change intensity low in the beginning to keep things under control!PHOTO SAND: Want to try making a sand version of one of your photos? Photo Sand picks the sand color directly from the photo you've chosen from your camera roll.

This software will present the user with the current Annals and JTCVS editions along with a summary or abstract of the published, peer-reviewed articles.The intended audience for this conversation consists of both peers and colleagues and also the lay public.  Ten members of the @tssmn will initiate monthly tweets when new articles are published in the fields of Adult Cardiac Surgery, Congenital Cardiac Surgery, and General Thoracic Surgery.  The tweets will contain the direct links to the articles.  However, for full text access, the reader will need a subscription or a proxy subscription through an academic institution to gain access to more than the article abstract.We hope to engage the professional and lay public, and we hope that this social media experiment will generate a lively and ongoing discussion about interesting Cardiothoracic surgical topics.The users of this app must be reminded that medicine and surgery are not exact sciences, that medical conditions vary from person to person, and that health care decisions are to be made by the patients, their families, and their health care providers.

When it is open, you are able to turn negative experiences in wisdom and knowledge. When it is closed, a person slowly undergoes a process of death and decay. It is said that one's success or failure in life is mainly determined by the state of this chakra alone.To balance this chakra, we created Throat Chakra Cleansing, an App that will allow you to play a 192Hz tone that will help you clear this energy center while meditating on it. This binaural isochronic tone can be made even more pleasant thanks to the 7 relaxing songs you can play in the background. The first one is free, while the others can be downloaded in the premium version. The titles of the tracks in our playlist are as follows, and can be used to heal your soul:1. Earth Tone 2. Life in Peace 3. Shamanic Healing 4. Serenity Song 5. Language of Light 6. Karma Connection 7. Release Fears To improve your experience, we added a timer to control exactly how long you will meditate. You can unlock it in the premium version, and set precisely how long to listen to our music to relax.Meditation on the fifth chakra is said to bring occult powers: the possibility of seeing past, present and future; resistance to diseases; destruction of dangers. While meditating on Vishuddha, if you wish to perform mantra chanting, you should repeat the mantra ha<U+1E43>, the syllable which is written in white upon this chakra.We hope you can improve your moments of harmony and serenity through this app. May it help you find peace and wellbeing through your seven chakras.

Best of all, there is no cost for the Thuasne3D Scan app, no conversion fees or any other added cost associated with using this technology.The Thuasne3D Scan app, in conjunction with the TechMed 3D software, also allows you to take photos, denote anatomical landmarks on the image, and write comments and instructions. It integrates the image capture and ordering process, and bundles all of these elements into one electronic file you can email to Townsend.When Townsend receives the file, Townsend uses proprietary processes to modify the image based on the patient information and brace options you select. The modified file is sent to a three axis mill to carve a positive model of the patient's limb that is used to fabricate the custom brace. For carbon fiber and composite braces, a vacuum lamination process is used. For aircraft aluminum braces, the metal parts are hand-contoured to intimately fit the leg model.Whether you are an iPad or iPhone user, Thuasne3D Scan is an accurate and efficient tool for ordering Townsend custom braces.

""Thunderstorm sounds"" is what you need!Our soothing music app has 16 relaxing sounds of the rain, wind and thunder that help you to sleep:Thunderstorm sounds.Different rain sounds (nature sounds) help you and your children fall asleep faster. Our nature music A thunderstorm, also known as an electrical storm, a lightning storm, thundershower or simply a storm, is a form of turbulent weather characterized by the presence of lightning and its acoustic effect on the Earth's atmosphere known as thunder. The meteorologically assigned cloud type associated with the thunderstorm is the cumulonimbus. Thunderstorms are usually accompanied by strong winds, heavy rain and sometimes snow, sleet, hail, or no precipitation at all. Those that cause hail to fall are called hailstorms. Thunderstorms may line up in a series or rainband, known as a squall line. Strong or severe thunderstorms may rotate, known as supercells. While most thunderstorms move with the mean wind flow through the layer of the troposphere that they occupy, vertical wind shear causes a deviation in their course at a right angle to the wind shear direction.Rain is liquid water in the form of droplets that have condensed from atmospheric water vapor and then precipitatedthat is, become heavy enough to fall under gravity. Rain is a major component of the water cycle and is responsible for depositing most of the fresh water on the Earth. It provides suitable conditions for many types of ecosystem, as well as water for hydroelectric power plants and crop irrigation.Sleep is a naturally recurring state characterized by reduced or absent consciousness, relatively suspended sensory activity, and inactivity of nearly all voluntary muscles. It is distinguished from quiet wakefulness by a decreased ability to react to stimuli, and is more easily reversible than being in hibernation or a coma. Sleep is a heightened anabolic state, accentuating the growth and rejuvenation of the immune, nervous, skeletal and muscular systems. It is observed in all mammals, all birds, and many reptiles, amphibians, and fish.Meditation is a practice in which an individual trains the mind or induces a mode of consciousness, either to realize some benefit or as an end in itself.Some of the great features:High quality Thunderstorm  soundsYou can customize sounds as you likeSimple and beautiful designTimer - so the app turns off automaticallyBeautiful background imagesYou can enjoy Sixteen different Thunderstorm  sounds:1.  3D Thunderstorm2.

While outside Olivia noticed a tick on her dog, Mo (short for Missouri). Olivia & her mom watched the tick start to burrow into Mos leg. They quickly found needle nose tweezers to properly remove the tick from Mo. As Olivia was removing the tick she asked her mom, Is there an app that can show what ticks are around us? That night Olivia looked online and found that currently there was no app to help track, report, and educate people about ticks. This gave Olivia the idea to create the TickTracker app to help keep everyone safe.Olivia has suffered from chronic Lyme and co-infections since she was 6 years old. She is a Lyme advocate and the founder of The LivLyme Foundation.ABOUT LIVLYME FOUNDATION:LivLyme Foundation is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization supporting the work of researchers and scientists who are dedicated to finding the effective treatment for Lyme disease and ultimately finding the cure. LivLyme Foundation also provides assistance to children and their families struggling with Lyme Disease through education and funding.We envision a world without Lyme. Working toward this goal, we will provide valuable resources to educate all, support those who are battling Lyme, and help develop the cure.ABOUT LYME DISEASE:Over 350,000 people are diagnosed with Lyme disease every year in the US. This equates to over 29,000 new cases every month, 959 new cases a day, 40 new cases every hour. As the fastest spreading vector-borne (tick-borne) disease in the US, the number of new cases of Lyme is 1.5 times greater than breast cancer and 7 times greater than HIV/AIDS. 200 children get Lyme disease every day, thats 4 school busses of children a day diagnosed with Lyme.The cost to treat Lyme disease is in excess of $1 billion per year, or approximately $3,000 per patient per year. But, the per-patient cost of treating PTLDS (Post Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome) can be in the $10,000  $100,000 range. Most insurance plans only cover treatment for the first month, leaving the patient with out of pocket expenses for medication, supplements and treatment.Another challenge that patients face is the rising cost of medicine. Doxycycline, an antibiotic routinely prescribed for treatment of Lyme disease, has increased from $.03 per pill to over $5.00 per pill since 2014. Many patients take two of these per day. Without help, some children wont be able to get the medication they need.";"TickTracker, LivLyme Foundation, Health & Fitness, Reference, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"1.0.4";12;"English, French, Spanish";1346060329;"LivLyme Foundation";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/livlyme-foundation/id1346060329?mt=8";0;NA;90,4;"2018-06-18";"2018-02-18";4,6;48;79;0;4;13;4;"2018-10-25";1;0;"Pediatrics";"Nutrition";"SensorySystemsHealthcare"

Like a diary, you can then record this moment with notes and other details for future reflection. When you go back and look through your notes you can easily see the different qualities for the moment and thereby see if a pattern of causality exists. This app was created primarily for Yoga practitioners who wish to organize their experiences with this information. Some explanations are provided by the app but it is expected that the user will research further or already have an inkling of the information presented.The app makes the calculations at the moment and does not depend on outside ephemera tables. Calculations are based primarily on the formulas presented in Jean Meeus Astronomical Algorithms. Other sources include Siddha Siddhanta Paddhati by Gorakhnath and Tirumantiram by Tirumular.  This first version is barebones. Future updates are planned in the coming weeks that will add more functionality and information.In older times, people followed not only seasonal cycles but other, more subtle cycles. Health was maintained by performing different activities at the proper time through intuitive understanding of Micro and Macrocosmic cycles. In the modern age we have lost our connection to these different cycles. The current popularity of Yoga mirrors a longing for a deeper resonance with our environment and search for ways to live complementary with nature. Through focus on the breath in Yoga, one can start to develop an intuitive feeling for the cycles. The ancients developed the sciences of Swara and Astrology to guide us to balance.

Every day we are faced with joys and challenges, our emotions can go from happy to sad, mad to glad in just seconds. Taking Time Out for Time In allows us to go from a reactive place to a responsive place in just minutes. To use this app start by noticing your thoughts, your worry or concern and be curious about how that stimulates feelings in you and then follow the prompts of the app to connect to your needs and notice how this allows you to have love and compassion for the part of you struggling. From this larger, more responsive place, see how you would like to proceed. It is that simple. A therapeutic app based on the different modalities I use often in my counseling and coaching sessions. The 2 main modalities Ive combined are Nonviolent communication and Psychosynthesis. Nonviolent communication has a few basic principles: Every action is an attempt to meet a need, Human needs are universal, Feelings result from needs being met or unmet, and everyones needs matter equally. Psychosynthesis is a map of the human psyche, a holistic way to understand human development, the basic idea is that we are always trying to grow and evolve into more of our authentic selves. One basic principle is that we are made up of parts, and that we are more than our parts. Another is that we assume synthesis, or growth is always trying to happen. Life is constantly trying to push us past our own limited beliefs and outdated strategies into wholeness and happiness. Putting Nonviolent communication and parts work together became of tool for self-compassion and love.

The ultimate application for tinnitus sufferers. Only naturally produced sounds of musical instruments and sounds of Mother Nature - no synthesizers! Developed by an expert software engineer in the field of frequency analysis and a leading music psychologist, music therapist and hearing therapist with more than 20 years experience in the treatment of tinnitus sufferers. Used very successfully in the treatment of tinnitus. Tinnitus Help contains a broad range of functions but operating it is childs play: 1. Accurate analysis of your tinnitus 2. Tinnitus masker and noiser 3. Reprogramming your auditory cortex 4. Stimulating your central auditory perception Helping you to 5. defocus 6. habituate 7. relax 8. fall asleep This is how it works: Tinnitus Help utilizes the fact that the same brain activities that enable us to perceive auditory stimuli, i.e. real sounds, also cause the perception of the tinnitus sound. Thus Tinnitus Help is able to intervene in central auditory processes. Tinnitus Help forms an image of your individual tinnitus frequency (up to 20.000 Hz) and offers you the option to mix this frequency with pleasant sounds or music. This means that Tinnitus Help can assist you to change the way you perceive your tinnitus sound by letting it gradually fade into the background. Regular listening to your individual Tinnitus Help setting will enable you to learn how to increasingly fade out the sound in your ear and eventually ignore it. Experts call this habituation. Step one: Establish your individual tinnitus frequency by using the slide switch. It does not matter if it is the left or the right ear that is affected or both. Are you suffering from tinnitus sounds that rise and fall? Or cricket like sounds? Or red noise? You can mix all additional sounds to your tinnitus frequency, thereby optimizing your tinnitus profile. Step two: Choose a pleasing sound and add it to your tinnitus profile. Using this combination, you will feel your tinnitus gradually fading into the background. What you are experiencing is the effect of defocusing. You have now created your own individual, perfect tinnitus masker, which you can call up any time anywhere. Set the time on how long you want your program to run for and use your tinnitus setting as masker to help you relax and to fall asleep. Step three: Influence the activity of your auditory cortex. The area in which your tinnitus frequency is located will be especially active and, depending on how frequently and how intensely you pay attention to your tinnitus, this area will spread like an ink stain on a piece of blotting paper. However, you can restrict the growth of this area by adding one of the pieces of music on offer to your setting. The music has been especially written for tinnitus sufferers. All pieces of music are produced naturally on musical instruments; no synthesizers are used. The association I am hearing pleasing sounds or music will at first be stored in the hippocampus, our memory centre. If the experience is repeated by using tinnitus help, the hippocampus works like a trainer for your cerebral cortex. It will repeatedly offer the stored information to the cerebral cortex, resulting in the new input being learnt and new programs etched into the auditory cortex. Regularly recurring musical structures act like a massage on certain areas of the brain. Where tinnitus is present, this will be experienced as a negative effect. However, you can turn this to your advantage by calling up your very own personalised music in your head. Retrieve it whenever you need it, influence your perception processes and learn to set up the reprogramming of your central auditory pathway. In general the tinnitus has the same frequency as the peak in your hearing loss. So use Tinnitus Help to stimulate your auditory cortex and to support your hearing.";"Tinnitus Help for iPad, IND-Ingenieurbuero f. Nachrichten- u.

During the latter, the patient listens to an artificially generated sound as similar as possible to the one his ear perceives for 4 to 6 hours a day. This sound masking mitigates the perception of sound, re-establishing a new threshold to auditory experiences.If the audio treatment is continued for 6 weeks straight, the symptoms of tinnitus are lessened considerably, and even appear to disappear completely.How to use this appTinnitus Relief Sound Masking System is avery modern system to find your tinnitus and provide a remedy. Wear some headphones. Select a masking sound from the list, choosing the one that most of all resembles the one perceived by your ears.Emit the sound by pressing the Play button.

CR Neuromodulation is designed to treat tinnitus that is characterized by a distinct tonal quality (including whistle, hum, or screech) and not broad atonal sounds (including white noise, crickets, or static). The app uses sample tinnitus sounds as defined by the American Tinnitus Association to determine whether it is tonal and therefore treatable with CR Neuromodulation therapy.How to UseThe Tinnitus Sound Finder app guides you through a step by step process. The app presents pairs of sounds from which you choose the closest sound to your tinnitus. This is repeated with different pairs of sounds to arrive at a categorization of your tinnitus. If your result is tonal, please contact a Desyncra clinic to discuss suitable treatment options for you. You may adjust the volume to ensure both your tinnitus and the apps sounds are audible throughout.

Originally released in 1999 as Tinnitus Tamer on the Mackintosh, and in 2012 on the iPad. The Tinnitus Tamer XS provides a much-simplified user interface for the same treatment techniques, which evolved from the original Tinnitus Tamer.     It is not commonly known that the acoustic nerve not only transmits electrical data from the inner ear to the brain stem, but also transmits information from the brain stem back to the inner ear *. The normal function of this negative feedback is to reduce the translation of acoustical background noise and loud signals into electrical signal by the inner ear. Any wave system with negative feedback can, under certain conditions, produce positive feedback. When this happens in the hearing process, it is referred to as Tinnitus.     The alternating tone and silence sequences produced by the Tinnitus Tamer affect the brain stem in a way to change the positive feedback back into negative feedback. Thus, the Tinnitus Tamer XS uses the resources of your own body to take care of the Tinnitus in a natural way.* Dr. Terry L. Levin      In some cases, the Tinnitus will rapidly disappear, but more likely, it will improve in stages: First, during a training session. Next, for a short period after a training session has ended. Gradually, the time of relief after a training session will increase. Eventually, the Tinnitus will be reduced to a low level that is of little bother. Many Tinnitus sufferers will find that the Tinnitus will be eliminated. Other will have to use the Tinnitus Tamer XS only when their Tinnitus flares up.";"Tinnitus Tamer XS, VAVsoft, Medical, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";NA;12;"English";555545464;"James Ludtke";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/vavsoft/id555545464?mt=8";10,99;"$";15,1;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;"2018-10-25";1;0;"MentalHealth&Neurology";"SensorySystemsHealthcare";NA

This is true for disorders characterized by compulsivity, impulsivity, and disturbed attention, but also for psychiatric disorders that involve severe emotional disturbances, such as major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorder and even psychotic disorders. Therefore translational, cross-disorder studies with a life span perspective from early vulnerability to late disease chronicity may enhance our knowledge and treatment possibilities for a very large group of patients representing a serious burden to families and society as a whole.The focus of the TN2-2018 conference is clinically oriented but with a strong background in translational neuroscience and deals in particular with the role of neuroinflammation in the etiology of psychiatric disorders and also on solutions to be found in the field neurostimuation. The vision is to gain knowledge that can be applied towards development of new patient oriented treatments through collaborative efforts.TN2 provides excellent opportunities for both clinicians and scientists to explore existing and new collaborations.";"TN2 2018, Academisch Medisch Centrum, Education, Medical, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"1.4";4;"English";708347667;"Academisch Medisch Centrum";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/academisch-medisch-centrum/id708347667?mt=8";0;NA;50,5;"2018-09-22";"2018-09-17";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;"2018-10-25";1;0;"MentalHealth&Neurology";NA;NA

The prognostic factors included in the new TNM are: Tumor Grade (G), HER2, Estrogen Receptor (ER) and Progesterone Receptor (PR). Genomic Profiles were also incorporated as a prognostic factor for eligible cases (pT1-T2 N0 M0 HER2- and ER+) in the Pathological Prognostic Stage.The Anatomic Stage is based solely on the anatomic extent of cancer as defined by the T, N, and M categories and should be used for all patients even if prognostic staging is possible.The Clinical Prognostic Stage will be used to assign stage for all patients based on history, physical examination, imaging studies, and relevant biopsies. Clinical Prognostic Stage is determined by cT, cN, c/pM, G, HER2, ER, and PR. Genomic profile information is not included in Clinical Prognostic Stage.The Pathological Prognostic Stage will be used to assign stage for patients who have the surgical resection as the initial treatment of their cancer before any systemic or radiation therapy. It includes all information used for clinical staging plus findings at surgery and pathological findings from surgical resection. Pathological Prognostic Stage is determined by pT, pN, c/pM, G, HER2, ER, and PR. Genomic profile information can be used for the Pathological Prognostic Stage (pT1-T2 N0, HER2- and ER+). Pathological Prognostic Stage does not apply to patients treated with chemotherapy, hormone therapy or radiation prior to surgical resection (neoadjuvant therapy).This App provides the quantification of the category change of the Clinical Prognosis Stage (cPS) and also the Pathological Prognostic Stage (pPS) in relation to the Anatomic Stage (AS) expressed in the Staging Line with the symbol +1, +2, +3 in case of worsening in the Prognostic Staging or -1, -2, -3 in case of improvement in the Prognostic Staging. When no symbol is shown, it is because the AS and cPS or AS and pPS are identical.This App has other function that shows Oncotype DX / Genomic Profile field only in some setting when the genomic test is potentially indicated (pT1-T2 N0, HER2- and ER+).This App is very useful for breast surgeons, surgical oncologists, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, pathologists, radiologists, medical students, scientists, researchers, and all healthcare professionals working in the field of breast oncology.

Its widely known that the drugs and treatments prescribed are not really designed to heal, they are just aimed at the symptoms. Many illnesses are wrongly diagnosed, as some symptoms shown are caused by other issues. This means sometimes people have several medications, when really the root cause needs the treatment, and of course the many symptoms will be dealt with at the same time. Frequency, or sound dates back to the time of Imohtep, some 7000 years ago. He is widely considered to be the father of medicine. He sketched 30 surgical procedures on papyrus, and used a lyre (a type of harp) and a harmonic choir to achieve the desired frequencies to heal. I have worked with energy and frequency for many years now, and have helped many thousands of people heal from various illness be it mental or physical using these methods. It has taken some time to hone various frequency to address different issues we may have. After you have listened to some of the audios in this app you will feel very relaxed, and at ""ease"" the word disease is made up of dis - ease, therefore restoring ease creates balance, or equilibrium. There is a free sample of self-healing in the app, by way of a chakra balance, and cleansing. Also there is an audio for stress and anxiety, which is on offer for only 99 cents!

You might find it becomes one of your favorites.-Open up one of the 6 emotions compartments if you believe you know your emotion(http://www.merriam-webster.com for a thesaurus to find synonyms for each emotion) and select acoping strategy to use. After using it rate your progress with this strategy by moving the ratings barfrom 1 (previously I would have used Unhealthy Coping to now this is my Healthiest Coping) to 10.If you progressed anywhere from 7-10 this card will also be stored in your Favorites compartment.-If you arent completely aware of your emotion(s) shuffle the cards and do the strategy that appears.Again rate yourself based on the emotion and the effectiveness of this strategy by moving the ratingsbar at the bottom. If this strategy improved your coping you now have new insight and vocabulary toexpress your emotion in the future and youve added this tool to your Toolbox.-Use a Keep or Share card and share it via email with someone else you believe can benefit fromits message.-Use Keep or Share cards, Encouragement cards, I Can C.O.P.E. cards, Get it in gear cardsand Human Equations cards when you want to reframe your thinking, boost your belief that you canembrace your emotions vs. needing to escape them and that you deserve to use healthier coping.-If you want to challenge your employees, family members or you are a teacher, school counselor ormental health professional you can play games as a family unit or in classes or groups. Three gameplaying cards exist that will randomly appear when you shuffle the cards. You might see an Aliencard, Ticket out of Denial card or a Wildcard. Be creative and invent ways to use these cards. Forexample, if an Alien card appears you might want to be honest about a recent time when you didntuse healthy coping and what happened. With a Ticket out of Denial card you might want to talk abouta time when you used a healthy coping strategy and how doing so improved your situation. And if aWildcard appears you might challenge yourself by doing the challenges for the Alien card in additionto the Ticket out of Denial card or you might get to select a family member, student or group memberto do either of the challenges for the other cards. But above all be creative and develop your ownuses too!";"Toolbox Coping Cards, Deborah Edmunds, Health & Fitness, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";NA;4;"English";985109072;"Deborah Edmunds";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/deborah-edmunds/id985109072?mt=8";3,99;"$";30;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;"2018-10-25";1;0;NA;NA;NA
