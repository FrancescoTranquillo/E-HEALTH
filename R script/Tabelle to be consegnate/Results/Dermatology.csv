The app is designed to provide a simple, intuitive interface to the ActivAngel sensor (required for use). Our goal was to make the software as easy to use as a traditional thermometer, but with many additional benefits:Immediate & continuous: The app connects to the sensor quickly and easily, providing accurate, immediate and continuous temperature data, without having to remember to take additional readings.Interactive graphs: Interactive graphs make it easy to see trends and make smarter decisions. Temperature trends can be used to understand when one is getting sick, to manage health conditions. The possibilities are endless!Customizable alerts: Smart alerts can notify one or more phones if a temperature hits a certain threshold (high or low). Parents need never again wake up in the middle of the night to wake up their children just to take their temperatures. Instead, they can catch up on their rest, confident that their phone will alert them of any important changes.Cloud synchronization: ActivAngel securely shares temperature data among multiple devices. That allows a parent, sibling, or caregiver to monitor temperature across town or around the world. Data can be exported to share with a healthcare professional or record in a spreadsheet.Multiple user tracking: One app can manage multiple ActivAngel sensors and multiple users, storing weeks or months of user data. One family can share a single sensor, linking it to a person as needed. Or that same family can have multiple sensors, each of them assigned to an individual for easy monitoring.Optional HealthKit connection, individual user can connect incoming data to own HealthKit.Designed for iPhone.The ActivAngel temperature sensor is accurate to 0.1C and is factory-calibrated for years of continuous temperature readings.Bluetooth Low Energy: BLE technology connects quickly and easily to a smartphone, managing wireless transmission throughout a typical home with little drain on the ActivAngel or phone battery.Small size (perfect for kids): The small ActivAngel temperature sensor is housed in a custom-designed, medical grade plastic case that is safe for children and sized for their smaller bodies.Rechargeable battery: An integrated lithium polymer (LiPo) battery can be charged quickly for few minutes to get it work (fully about in 120 minutes) with the included micro USB cable, providing up to 7 days of continuous usage on a single charge.Medical-grade adhesives: We use medical-grade adhesive similar to that found in high-quality bandages  safe for children and sensitive skin, whether worn for hours or days (35 days is the recommended limit before replacing).";"ActivAngel, Biophilia KFT, Health & Fitness, Medical, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"0";4;"English";1311390936;"Biophilia KFT";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/biophilia-kft/id1311390936?mt=8";0;"0";54,9;"0";"0";0;0;0;0;0;0;0;"2018-10-24";1;0;"Dermatology";"MentalHealth&Neurology";"Pediatrics";0;0;0;0,706738544474394;0;0;0,155482479784367

It is also an opportunity to learn new things and be innovative. Many people, mostly women, want to age gracefully and look youthful. They usually know what they want. So, with her carefully curated treatments Dr. Alice offers immediately measurable changes with minimally invasive procedures. Best results in face and body enhancements are attained with minimal recovery time, using the most sophisticated tools and appropriate procedures. The most popular treatment in her clinics is body shaping, using the Lipo Selection method. Permanent fat reduction is achieved in one sitting, with her patients immediately returning to their daily routine. Naturally, she tests procedures on herself to detect body sensations and reactions. This helps her gauge recovery period, too, as most of her patients are pressed for time. Dr. Alice is already moving ahead. She says the next step in cosmetic enhancement is to permanently reduce fat, refashion skin tone and rejuvenate cells to self-repair damaged skin. She will also be launching her Holistic Wellness Centre in April 2012. Despite the common misconceptions about the cosmetic surgery industry, Dr. Alice is confident that practitioners expertise lies in their qualifications, licenses and experience. Thus, she spends a lot of time at the diagnosis stage to advise her patients, as well as structuring procedures that suit them best. The essence of beauty, Dr Alice believes, is measurable: a positive outlook, healthy self-esteem and growing confidence, all of which are noted in her book to help her patients achieve their potential.

Having patients in day clothes not pyjamas (PJs) or gowns adds to enhanced dignity, autonomy and experience as well as shortening length of stay for patients, many of whom may be in their last 1000 days. For patients over the age of 80, a week in bed can lead to 10 years of muscle ageing, 1.5 kg of muscle loss and many other problems related to so-called deconditioning and it affects people at all ages, particularly older people.The #EndPJparalysisappcaptures the answers to two simple questions each day:1. How many patients are dressed in day clothes at midday?2. Of these dressed patients, how many have mobilised e.g. walked to the toilet / shower or walked around the bed?This will enable us to:- Compare same-type wards in different hospitals, care homes etc e.g. medical, surgical, rehab etc- Show how hospital is doing compared to other hospitals for number and percentage of patients up, dressed and moving- Country by country performance comparisonsJoin us in the #endPJparalysis Challenge that further demonstrates the importance of nursing, midwifery and care staff to deliver positive outcomes for patients.";"#EndPJparalysis, Cambridge Digital Health, Health & Fitness, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"2.1.0";12;"English";1297295745;"Cambridge Digital Health Ltd.";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/cambridge-digital-health/id1297295745?mt=8";0;"0";21,3;"2018-04-20";"2018-02-25";0;0;0;0;0;0;0;"2018-10-24";1;0;"Dermatology";"Nutrition";"0";0;0;0;0,295417789757412;0,93961038961039;0;0,177745160499877

Food intolerances and food poisoning are separate conditionsCommon allergens include pollen and food. Metals and other substances may also cause problems. Food, insect stings, and medications are common causes of severe reactions. Their development is due to both genetic and environmental factors. The underlying mechanism involves immunoglobulin E antibodies (IgE), part of the body's immune system, binding to an allergen and then to a receptor on mast cells or basophils where it triggers the release of inflammatory chemicals such as histamine.Diagnosis is typically based on a person's medical history. Further testing of the skin or blood may be useful in certain cases. Positive tests, however, may not mean there is a significant allergy to the substance in questionWith this app you can learn on the Go, Anytime & Everywhere.

However, there is not only one department body in the entire group.

This App helpful list when studying for a science test with anatomy picture of organs in human body. You'll also find links how many organs are in the human body!. There are more than 22 organs in the human body. This is a list of the ten most vital organs which is usually taught about in elementary school. You will learn about the internal organs of human body job or function, as well as some interesting facts!.The skin : is the largest organ in the human body. Its main job is to maintain the body's temperature, which means that sweat is created to cool the body, and goosebumps or raised hair occur to trap heat in the body. Along with sweat glands, the skin contains oil glands. The oil your skin releases helps to keep your skin from drying out and your hair from becoming brittle.The heart : is another vital organ. The heart's job is to pump oxygenated blood throughout your body and receive deoxygenated blood back in return. Without your heart, your other organs would not receive oxygen or have carbon dioxide removed. In an average lifetime, the heart beats more than 2.5 million times!picture of organs in human body.The kidneys : are located under the rib-cage in your lower back. The job of the kidneys is to filter things like water and salts out of your blood and to produce urine. The kidneys also produce an enzyme called rennin. This enzyme plays a big role in regulating your blood pressure. Did you know that a healthy person is able to live with only kidney?.The liver : is located in the upper abdomen, slightly more to the left side. The main job of the liver is to produce bile, which it sends to the stomach for digestion. The liver also filters out toxins and regulates blood sugar. Blood sugar is regulated because the liver converts sugars and stores them, releasing them when more sugar is needed in the blood. The liver is also in charge of releasing cholesterol, breaking down fats, and producing blood proteins. It is the largest internal organ!.The pancreas : is located in the abdomen, behind the stomach. The job of the pancreas is to produce enzymes necessary for digestion and send them to the stomach. The pancreas also regulates blood sugar and does this through its process of creating insulin. The pancreas also creates glucagon which has the opposite effect of insulin and also helps to maintain blood sugar levels.The stomach : receives food from the esophagus and sends it into the small intestine. The stomach's role in digestion is to break down food and mix it with digestive juices or enzymes.The lungs : are located in your chest and are protected by your rib cage. The lungs take in oxygen which goes into the blood through the heart, and expels carbon dioxide as the heart receives oxygenated blood.With this application you will find about internal organs of human body and their functions with human body organs picture for you now.";"Anatomy Human Body Organs, Hasyim Mulyono, Health & Fitness, Reference, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"1.15";12;"English";1137411855;"Hasyim Mulyono";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/hasyim-mulyono/id1137411855?mt=8";0;"0";45,8;"2017-05-26";"2016-09-23";0;0;0;0;0;0;0;"2018-10-25";1;0;"Dermatology";"Cardiology";"Nutrition";0;0;0;1;0,832467532467532;0;0,319896103896104

In some of its facets, anatomy is related to embryology and comparative anatomy, which itself is closely related to evolutionary biology and phylogeny.[3] Human anatomy is one of the basic essential sciences of medicine.[4] The discipline of anatomy is divided into macroscopic and microscopic anatomy. Macroscopic anatomy, or gross anatomy, is the examination of an animals body parts using unaided eyesight. Gross anatomy also includes the branch of superficial anatomy. Microscopic anatomy involves the use of optical instruments in the study of the tissues of various structures, known as histology and also in the study of cells.The history of anatomy is characterized by a progressive understanding of the functions of the organs and structures of the human body. Methods have also improved dramatically, advancing from the examination of animals by dissection of carcasses and cadavers (corpses) to 20th century medical imaging techniques including X-ray, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging.";"Anatomy & Physiology +2700 Study Notes & Exam Quiz, Karim SLITI, Education, Medical, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"1.0";12;"English";1049042697;"Karim SLITI";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/karim-sliti/id1049042697?mt=8";2,99;"$";20,9;"2015-12-18";"2015-12-18";0;0;0;0;0;0;0;"2018-10-25";1;0;"Dermatology";"GinecologyAndObstetrics";"Cardiology";0;0;0;0,912129380053908;0,662026515151515;0;0,280111645430042

If you go outside in mosquito ridden areas, wear long pants and shirts, preferably made from a tight knit fabric.Mosquitoes breed and live in bushes and shrubs as well as near open water like ponds or lakes so if you are planning on heading to such an area, make sure you follow the rules above, and bring your mosquito repellent!";"Anti Mosquito Repeller - Ultrasonic, Andrew Neal, Health & Fitness, Medical, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"1.0.1";4;"English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian, Simplified Chinese, Spanish";1102865152;"Andrew Neal";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/andrew-neal/id1102865152?mt=8";0;"0";7;"2016-11-15";"2016-09-28";0;0;0;0;0;0;0;"2018-10-25";1;0;"Dermatology";"Nutrition";"0";0;0;0;0,569541778975741;0,770143398268398;0;0,217716399166871

It is caused by allergies against environmental allergies, such as pollen, house dust mites, moulds, etc. CAD accounts for around 60% of all allergies seen in dogs. It is characterised by a vicious cycle of inflammation, pruritus and excoriation, leading to repeated skin damage. CAD is difficult to diagnose. The diagnosis is based on excluding other causes of dermatitis, such as fleas, food allergy, etc. The Canine Atopic Dermatitis Extent and Severity Index (CADESI)-4 has been developed by leading veterinary dermatologists. With this scoring system the vet can see how serious the disease is, and once treated, measure the progress. It is also a very visual way to explain the situation and improvements to clients. Management of patients with CAD is equally difficult, and often requires life-long multimodal management, including environmental modification, drugs, shampoos, topicals and specially formulated nutrition.  * References:1.

Tracking this data helps you improve your personal wellbeing, but this data is also an invaluable resource for advancing public health. Bitmark makes it easy, fun, and safe to donate your health data to health researchers. The decentralized Bitmark mobile app gives you secure, direct control over your personal data and digital assets by allowing you to easily register, track, and donate your personal data to the studies that matter most to you. Research fellows at Berkeleys School of Public Health are using Bitmark to power a new generation of public health studies. These studies crowdsource personal data from individual donors to get exactly the kind of data they need. Donors have complete control over whom they share their data with and when. By interacting digitally, researchers are able to gain data that has been previously too sensitive or too inaccessible to use.This partnership marks a significant step toward technology innovation for health research, affording transparent access to data, providing a wide and diverse population for crowdsourcing, and automating donor consent.FOR PARTICIPANTSInterested participants can browse various studies that they want to participate in. Once a user selects a study, they can securely and anonymously donate their data over an encrypted data transfer network. The Bitmark blockchain establishes an authenticated, permanent record of data donation that ensures data accountability and donor consent while protecting sensitive donor information.FOR RESEARCHERSUsing the Bitmark system, researchers can broadcast Requests for Data (RFDs) which define the frequency and types of data required for their studies. They can then collect data over the encrypted data transfer network and crowdsource for the particular data that is most imperative to their study.  The Bitmark system does three things:- Structures and indexes personal data and converts it to digital property using the Bitmark blockchain - Protects your data ownership rights by securing data provenance with a bitmark- Provides a safe mechanism to store and transfer personal data By using Bitmark you will be able to: - Browse & select the health studies that interest you - Link your iOS health app on your phone to the studies that you choose - Donate your data, securely, safely, and with your full consent - Track where your data goes and continue donating!";"Bitmark, Bitmark Inc, Health & Fitness, Utilities, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"1.3.8";4;"English, Catalan, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish";1121871769;"Bitmark Inc.";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/bitmark-inc/id1121871769?mt=8";0;"0";48,8;"2018-08-07";"2017-03-22";0;0;0;0;0;0;0;"2018-10-25";1;0;"Dermatology";"Nutrition";"EmergencyMedicine";0;0;0;0,610242587601078;0,974675324675325;0;0,251214408233276

Now more than 16 years on, the many trees and gorse bushes that were planted to complement the existing trees have matured and so helped to give not only a very scenic course but a challenging one for all abilities.Brampton Heath was the only golf club in Northamptonshire to stay open throughout last winter (except during snow), never using tee mats. Trolleys are always permitted, as are buggies, unless there are exceptional circumstances.Play is permitted from the White or Yellow tees so that players of better ability can play the course at its longest, 6662 yards.For the Golfers the app features the Whole in One Golf GPS Range Finder and Digital Guide to playing the 18 Hole Championship Course.

Nurse Elise Srensen was concerned by the dramatic change in her sisters lifestyle following an ostomy operation. Thora no longer dared to go out, fearing that her stoma would leak in public. Elise was determined to help her sister out of her isolation.She came up with the idea of an ostomy bag with an adhesive ring, which would make it fit tightly to the skin. This would prevent leakage and give her sister  and thousands of people like her  the chance to return to their normal life.Today, our business includes ostomy care, continence care, urology care, wound care and skin care.

Inspired from Gordon Ramsay and Rachael Ray recipes, the selection can help people with celiac disease or other gluten or wheat intolerance make their own gluten free treats at home.It has all you need for a gluten free healthy diet that excludes foods containing gluten. Gluten is a protein composite found in wheat (including kamut and spelt), barley, rye and triticale. A gluten-free diet is the only medically accepted treatment for celiac disease. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disease attacking the small intestine due to the presence of gluten. Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a form of celiac disease in which gluten causes the immune system to attack the skin; therefore a gluten-free diet is essential. People with these diseases are considered gluten intolerant. There is a minority of people who suffer from wheat intolerance alone and are tolerant to gluten. Gluten sensitivity is another reason people will choose to go gluten-free.We will continue updating this application with new recipes on a regular basis.";"Gluten Free Recipes - Organised Recipes by Entry, Main Course and Deserts, Kien Nguyen Chi, Food & Drink, Health & Fitness, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"1.1";4;"English";1326500792;"Kien Nguyen Chi";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/kien-nguyen-chi/id1326500792?mt=8";0;"0";43,1;"2016-02-15";"2015-12-18";0;0;0;0;0;0;0;"2018-10-25";1;0;"Dermatology";"Gastroenterology";"Nutrition";0;0;0;0,242857142857143;0,681182359307359;0;0,135170454545455

Roger was inspired to start GNatural Herbal Products when he noticed that his own hair was thinning, balding and developing a receding hairline; he tried many products on the market with little or no success. So, with his 15 years of cosmetology experience and a vision or voice he heard in his head pushing him to create his own cure, Roger was determined to create the right hair product by using natural herbal ingredients that will add moisture, stimulation, and circulation to his scalp, while also promoting hair growth. He used his knowledge of herbal extracts Tocopheryl, Calendula, Rosemary, Comfrey, Aloe, Matricaria, Sage their ancient healing power and started experimenting with different herbal ingredients and essential oils like jojoba, olive, sunflower, safflower, lavender in his kitchen. The result of his continuous labor led to the creation of his first product: The hair and scalp conditioner and then the hair growth oil was created in 1997. He used his new creation himself for a year with much success. Everyone noticed the difference in his hair and how healthy it looked. He started to notice that his hairline was returning. Roger then shared the products with family and friends. Rogers mother Evangelist Lillian Gore started sending him to church members and neighbors to share the newly created hair and scalp. Word of mouth spread quickly of the results of natural hair growth in using Rogers newly created hair and scalp conditioner. Roger was ready to give his brand a name. It took him a while to think of a name for his new company but he knew it had to contain the word natural. Roger comes from a deep spiritual background his late Mother Lillian Gore was an Evangelist she shared with him always put God first in all you do. So Roger thought God Natural then shortened it to GNatural. So the G in GNatural stands for God. The brand GNatural was born. His mother was pleased with the name and she said now you have the healing power of God in every product. In 2000, GNatural expanded its products line to include the full natural hair and skin system:  Oh So Clean Shampoo, Mint Fortress Conditioner,  Leave In Conditioners, Body and Hair Butter, Hair Puddings and the famous Get-It-G Razor Relief. Roger insist on using 10 percent of the sales to reinvest back into his community through churches, nonprofit organizations, nursing homes, seniors & elderly homes, African villages and county schools. It started out a gesture of gratitude and his religious beliefs. Now Roger formed GNatural Gives to represent his philosophy of giving back. GNatural does little or no advertisement majority of the sales come from word of mouth or someone has tried a sample of the products. Roger thanks his late mother for her words of wisdom and he owes the success of the GNatural brand to if you put God first in all you do the rest will take care of itself!

Due to the nuances, this 'refined Hurley classification' offers the possibility to accurately characterize the different phenotypes of HS.

Your face will be as relaxed as after 8 hours of sleep. Why does PLAY SKIN work? Very low intensity micro-currents are not invasive or perceivable. They act both at muscle and cell level, which improves skin elasticity and tone and, at the same time, they electrically charge the hydrogel mask to enhance the action of moisturizing and anti-aging components. The result? Face muscles recover their original tone; your skin will immediately look oxygenated, lifted and soft. You can repeat the treatment 2/3 times a week for long-lasting results or when you need to recover the beauty of a relaxed and rested face in just 10 minutes. App includes a practical and quick guide to be consulted before, after and during the treatment. Mirror function to easily apply your face mask wherever you are. Visual feedback and vibration when the treatment is started or stopped. Enjoy 10 minutes of a total relax treatment as you do not have to worry when it will finish. Moreover, during treatment you can view and request in real time our best offers on beauty products, exclusive services and much more. Discover this comfortable function in the interactive banner available after the treatment starts. You are kindly asked to carefully read the manual in the original package and/or the terms of service available on the Baldan Group website.Find out more: www.playskin.it/en";"Play Skin, DigitalX srl, Health & Fitness, Lifestyle, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"1.1.1";4;"English, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish";1033532911;"DigitalX srl";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/digitalx-srl/id1033532911?mt=8";0;"0";21,8;"2016-11-29";"2016-11-10";0;0;0;0;0;0;0;"2018-10-26";1;0;"Dermatology";"GinecologyAndObstetrics";"MentalHealth&Neurology";0;0;0;0,459029649595687;0,774364177489177;0;0,193910224209753

Several conditions are covered, like rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthropathy, psoriatic arthritis, microcrystalline arthritis (gout), lupus (SLE), osteoarthritis, etc. The benefits for the patients are numerous: reduce the frequency of visits to the rheumatologist (in agreement with the rheumatologist), detect earlier the failure/inefficacy of an ongoing treatment, and thus earlier adpatation of the therapeutic strategy. This adds up naturally to the fact that the user has an objective idea of his/her status with respect to a rheumatic condition and its evolution over time, which in itself is a benefit. The app thus really allows to follow the ""treat-to-target"" trend. This mobile application can be connected to RheumaKit.com, a web platform for personalized medicine in Rheumatology to be used by the clinicians. Each clinician can store a much larger collection of information of interest regarding each patient. The types of information that can be managed by the clinicians are related to treatment, to diagnosis or to disease activity and can include biological and even genomic testing. Currently, the mobile application allows the follow-up of the user via three self-reported metrics: the simplified Health Assessment Questionaire (HAQ-DI), the Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data 3 (RAPID3), recommended by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR), and the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS).

There is also training for post graduates specialising in general medicine in the form of registrar rotations through Rheumatology, as well as formal teaching for the Part 1 and Part 2 of the FCP (SA) examinations. Medical registrars rotating through the unit are encouraged to undertake rheumatology topics for the MPhil degree. The Division is highly suited for training super specialists in Rheumatology due to the wide spectrum of rheumatic diseases that are treated in the different clinics.Service is provided through several outpatient clinics and inpatients admitted to the general medical wards as well as the orthopaedic wards. Patients with severe RA may be admitted for surgery or for rehabilitation purposes. There are 2 new patient clinics per week and 2 follow-up clinics per week. In addition, a weekly Connective Tissue Diseases clinic has been established for treating patients with SLE, Scleroderma, Myositis and different forms of vasculitis, especially Takayasus Disease.The Division of Rheumatology has several research interests relating to different aspects of the rheumatic diseases. Osteoporosis is an area of interest for many years and there is ongoing collection of longitudinal bone mineral density data in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Age-related bone loss at different skeletal sites is being prospectively studied in collaboration with the Department of Nuclear Medicine and the Endocrine Unit. Clinical drug trials are in progress to study the safety and efficacy of the newer non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), in collaboration with the GIT Unit. These newer COXIBS are being evaluated in patients with RA and osteoarthritis (OA). All of these include collaborative participation with the GIT Unit, where gastropathy is an outcome variable, measured by gastroscopy. Recently, the trials of coxibs have included cardiovascular outcomes as well. We have also been looking at SLE genetics in collaboration with the Hepatology Unit at UCT. Newer areas of research include the study of chronic tophaceous GOUT; community aspects of diagnosing and treating rheumatic diseases at CHCs; early rheumatoid arthritis; genetics of bone loss in SLE; and functional problems in ankylosing spondylitis and DMARDs in Psoriatic Arthritis. More recently, we have been involved in studies looking at the short-term and long-term effects of biologic therapiesin the different rheumatic diseases, especially RA.The rheumatic diseases unit provides in- and outpatient rheumatology services for the entire Western Cape region. Sessions are carried out at the Heideveld and Khayelitsha Community Health Centres 6 times a year. Training is provided on a continuous basis for medical students, allied health professionals, a senior house officer, two rotating medical registrars and two career registrars. Research is largely clinically orientated, but a laboratory-based approach is being used to study the genetics of SLE and the differentiation between flares and infection in SLE patients. Family studies have also been started in patients with SLE and RA. In addition, there is very significant involvement in clinical drug trials in rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriatic arthritis and osteoarthritis. Collaborative research is being carried out with the Liver Unit to study bone density in auto-immune hepatitis.";"Rheumatology UCT, Rory Leisegang, Medical, Education, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"1.2.3";17;"English";974981909;"Rory Leisegang";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/rory-leisegang/id974981909?mt=8";0;"0";14,4;"2018-01-17";"2016-02-01";0;0;0;0;0;0;0;"2018-10-25";1;0;"Dermatology";"Cardiology";"Gastroenterology";0;0;0;0,922911051212938;0,909104437229437;0;0,312132963734379

It reduces the signs of aging by renewing the glow of the skin and providing a youthful look to the face. Cosmetic acupuncture needles create stimulation to areas of facial tissue by increasing the circulation of blood flow to the wrinkles and thus producing more collagen production, resulting in less wrinkle formation.  Cosmetic acupuncture is an ancient healing art that has been practiced in China for emperors and empresses as a beauty ritual for at least 5,000 thousand years. The treatment involves inserting tiny, hair-like needles into the face and others into the body in order to increase the blood circulation and collagen production within the skin. This allows the skin to be nourished, oxygenated and moisturized from the inside out. Additionally, the increased production of collagen tightens the skin. Hence, the treatment improves the complexion and elasticity of the skin.  During each treatment, medical acupuncture is used, meaning that body needles are placed to work on stress levels, pain, insomnia or anything else that is currently bothering the patient.   This helps immensely in the outcome of radiant skin as the body is all connected.  Cosmetic acupuncture is currently all the rage among Hollywoods elite, and its popularity is understandable.  It promises a more youthful appearance with no downtime, no anesthesia, no harmful chemicals or toxins injected and no going under the knife.";"Romy Simone, Shore.com Inc., Health & Fitness, Medical, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"1.8";4;"English";1248260556;"Shore.com Inc.";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/shore-com-inc/id1248260556?mt=8";0;"0";25;"2018-03-29";"2017-06-26";0;0;0;0;0;0;0;"2018-10-25";1;0;"Dermatology";"Cardiology";"MentalHealth&Neurology";0;0;0;0,377628032345013;0,932142857142857;0;0,194935309973046

There areat least two hundred distinct cell types, all with differentfeatures and functions, such as neurons (nerve cells), livercells, skin cells, and so on. These specialised cells arethe body's mature or fully differentiated, cells, all ofwhich are derived from their common ancestors, stem cells.Stem cells are a class of undifferentiated cells that areable to differentiate into specialized cell types. Commonly,stem cells come from two main sources:1. Embryos formed during the blastocyst phase ofembryological development (embryonic stem cells) and 2.Adult tissue (adult stem cells).Both types are generally characterized by their potency, orpotential to differentiate into different cell types (suchas skin, muscle, bone, etc.).Stem cells have the remarkable potential to develop intomany different cell types in the body during early life andgrowth. In addition, in many tissues they serve as a sort ofinternal repair system, dividing essentially without limitto replenish other cells as long as the person or animal isstill alive. When a stem cell divides, each new cell has thepotential either to remain a stem cell or become anothertype of cell with a more specialized function, such as amuscle cell, a red blood cell, or a brain cell.Stem cells are distinguished from other cell types by twoimportant characteristics. First, they are unspecializedcells capable of renewing themselves through cell division,sometimes after long periods of inactivity. Second, undercertain physiologic or experimental conditions, they can beinduced to become tissue- or organ-specific cells withspecial functions. In some organs, such as the gut and bonemarrow, stem cells regularly divide to repair and replaceworn out or damaged tissues. In other organs, however, suchas the pancreas and the heart, stem cells only divide underspecial conditions.";"Stem Cell, BIRANCHI N, Medical, Education, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes";"0";9;"English";879967039;"BIRANCHI N";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/biranchi-n/id879967039?mt=8";0;"0";3;"0";"0";2,4;23;17;13;4;17;48;"2018-10-26";1;0;"Dermatology";"MentalHealth&Neurology";"Cardiology";0,277777777777778;0,00225140712945591;0;0,484636118598383;0;0;0,154224907525874
