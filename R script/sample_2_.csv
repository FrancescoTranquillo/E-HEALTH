They are medical students and teachers, primary healthcare providers, physicians, practitioners, and nurses. Join them today to get your ECG knowledge refresh.Medical App Editor's Review:Here is a beautiful app with rich collection of real 12-lead ECG cases you can use to develop your interpretation skills. Each case is identified with a brief description (e.g., ""Male 73 y/o, HR 158; Ectopic arrhythmia - atrial tachycardia with intraventricular aberrant conduction...""). Select a case and you can choose either Play mode, which shows you the ECG telemetry as you'd see it on a monitor in real time, with beeps for heartbeats, or Read mode, which gives you the printed ECG tracing to interpret. You can choose cases by category or search for them by name. You can also bookmark cases and return to them later.For students and practitioners who wish to strengthen their ECG-reading capabilities, this app would seem justified, because ECG Cases gives you an effective way to immerse yourself in a wide range of ECG patterns and interact with them as if these were your own patients.Customer Reviews:1. Excellent for review of multiple rhythms. You'll need to come with your basic understanding of EKG interpretation but the app is great for a challenge.2. Great variety of cases and interpretation help break down the rhythms. Perfect way for students to study3. It is a great learning tool. I use this app for school and it helps out a lot for understanding how to read them and what to look for.4. Excellent learning tool for newbies and as ongoing refresher for others. Great examples5. Very detailed app for learning ECGs, all my staff has this app for continued learning.6. As a medic student this app is amazing. It's helped me a lot more than I could have hoped for.7. I have been a paramedic for 15 yrs, I found this app to be an excellent tool for refreshing and expanding my knowledge8. Great app. Most of strips are above my skill level a a paramedic but still fun to play and learn. Very well rendered. Would be nice if there was a ""basic"" version of this for paramedics and nurses. Also a brief explanation of why a strip is interpreted the way it is would be helpful.""I'm reviewing the app with my father who happens to be a specialist in internal medicine, and we're astonished with this app capabilities in helping students like myself understand EKG waves. It's not easy but with the help of this app EKG makes more sense to me.""""This is a great App that exemplifies and provides easy training for medical professionals.
